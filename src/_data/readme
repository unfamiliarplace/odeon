# This folder contains cleaned data, namely that of a poetry corpus and prose
# corpus both subdivided by genre, a pronunciation dictionary, and a synonym
# dictionary (thesaurus). They are accessed by tools in the resources package.

# Expanding this data is not difficult. The corpus is entirely gleaned from
# Project Gutenberg. Certain operations to make the data amenable to reading
# were carried out, such as removing line numbers and [comments]. If you wish
# to add your own genres of poetry and prose, simply make subfolders. They
# will be detected and added to the options presented to you, and by default
# will be loaded with all the other genres.
