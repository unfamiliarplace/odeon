 MARCH: AN ODE

 


 I

 Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour
   of winter had passed out of sight,
 The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that
   fulfil us in sleep with delight;
 The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and
   branches that glittered and swayed
 Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that
   outlightens all flowers till it fade
 That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night
   than the day, nor the day than the night,
 Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had
   the madness and might in thee made,
 March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that
   enkindle the season they smite.


 II

 And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and
   ravin and spoil of the snow,
 And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the
   tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low,
 How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the
   year that exults to be born
 So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose
   laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn?
 Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy
   forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow
 As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment
   and tresses yet wasted and torn,
 Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel
   through her spirit the sense of thee flow.


 III

 Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the
   sun have dispelled and consumed,
 Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous
   burden the branches implumed
 Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds
   are, but petalled as flowers,
 Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a
   fountain that shines as it showers,
 But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till
   by time or by tempest entombed,
 As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is
   no more than an hour's,
 One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the
   snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed.


 IV

 As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and
   yields up his kingdom to May;
 So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes
   in passion away,
 And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with
   tears or thanksgivings; but thou,
 Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months,
   to what goal hast thou gone from us now?
 For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the
   beat of thy wings that play,
 Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we
   know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow
 Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that
   impelled it on quest as for prey.


 V

 Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the
   winds of the waste north sea?
 Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is
   stormful and strong like thee
 Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs
   assailed by the blast of thy breath?
 Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the
   word that the changed year saith,
 Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from
   spirits triumphant as we
 Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's
   rearisen from a sleep that was death
 And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine?
   hast thou set not the whole world free?


 VI

 For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of
   thy spirit, the sound of thy song,
 Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the
   hands of thy kingdom are strong,
 Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and
   fruitful of births divine,
 Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights
   that are drunken with dew for wine,
 And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a
   denser and fierier throng,
 And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at
   heart as they strengthen and shine,
 And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of
   thy reign that it wrought not wrong.


 VII

 Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the
   crown of the steep sky's arch,
 And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise
   of the thorn and the larch:
 Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the
   wildest of winds that blow,
 Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden
   with blossom are sprinkled with snow,
 And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live
   woods feel not the frost's flame parch;
 For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt
   at the heart of the forest aglow,
 And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands
   of the gods of the winds of March.




 THE COMMONWEAL

 


 I

 Eight hundred years and twenty-one
   Have shone and sunken since the land
   Whose name is freedom bore such brand
 As marks a captive, and the sun
   Beheld her fettered hand.


 II

 But ere dark time had shed as rain
   Or sown on sterile earth as seed
   That bears no fruit save tare and weed
 An age and half an age again,
   She rose on Runnymede.


 III

 Out of the shadow, starlike still,
   She rose up radiant in her right,
   And spake, and put to fear and flight
 The lawless rule of awless will
   That pleads no right save might.


 IV

 Nor since hath England ever borne
   The burden laid on subject lands,
   The rule that curbs and binds all hands
 Save one, and marks for servile scorn
   The heads it bows and brands.


 V

 A commonweal arrayed and crowned
   With gold and purple, girt with steel
   At need, that foes must fear or feel,
 We find her, as our fathers found,
   Earth's lordliest commonweal.


 VI

 And now that fifty years are flown
   Since in a maiden's hand the sign
   Of empire that no seas confine
 First as a star to seaward shone,
   We see their record shine.


 VII

 A troubled record, foul and fair,
   A simple record and serene,
   Inscribes for praise a blameless queen,
 For praise and blame an age of care
   And change and ends unseen.


 VIII

 Hope, wide of eye and wild of wing,
   Rose with the sundawn of a reign
   Whose grace should make the rough ways plain,
 And fill the worn old world with spring,
   And heal its heart of pain.


 IX

 Peace was to be on earth; men's hope
   Was holier than their fathers had,
   Their wisdom not more wise than glad:
 They saw the gates of promise ope,
   And heard what love's lips bade.


 X

 Love armed with knowledge, winged and wise,
   Should hush the wind of war, and see,
   They said, the sun of days to be
 Bring round beneath serener skies
   A stormless jubilee.


 XI

 Time, in the darkness unbeholden
   That hides him from the sight of fear
   And lets but dreaming hope draw near,
 Smiled and was sad to hear such golden
   Strains hail the all-golden year.


 XII

 Strange clouds have risen between, and wild
   Red stars of storm that lit the abyss
   Wherein fierce fraud and violence kiss
 And mock such promise as beguiled
   The fiftieth year from this.


 XIII

 War upon war, change after change,
   Hath shaken thrones and towers to dust,
   And hopes austere and faiths august
 Have watched in patience stern and strange
   Men's works unjust and just.


 XIV

 As from some Alpine watch-tower's portal
   Night, living yet, looks forth for dawn,
   So from time's mistier mountain lawn
 The spirit of man, in trust immortal,
   Yearns toward a hope withdrawn.


 XV

 The morning comes not, yet the night
   Wanes, and men's eyes win strength to see
   Where twilight is, where light shall be
 When conquered wrong and conquering right
   Acclaim a world set free.


 XVI

 Calm as our mother-land, the mother
   Of faith and freedom, pure and wise,
   Keeps watch beneath unchangeful skies,
 When hath she watched the woes of other
   Strange lands with alien eyes?


 XVII

 Calm as she stands alone, what nation
   Hath lacked an alms from English hands?
   What exiles from what stricken lands
 Have lacked the shelter of the station
   Where higher than all she stands?


 XVIII

 Though time discrown and change dismantle
   The pride of thrones and towers that frown,
   How should they bring her glories down--
 The sea cast round her like a mantle,
   The sea-cloud like a crown?


 XIX

 The sea, divine as heaven and deathless,
   Is hers, and none but only she
   Hath learnt the sea's word, none but we
 Her children hear in heart the breathless
   Bright watchword of the sea.


 XX

 Heard not of others, or misheard
   Of many a land for many a year,
   The watchword Freedom fails not here
 Of hearts that witness if the word
   Find faith in England's ear.


 XXI

 She, first to love the light, and daughter
   Incarnate of the northern dawn,
   She, round whose feet the wild waves fawn
 When all their wrath of warring water
   Sounds like a babe's breath drawn,


 XXII

 How should not she best know, love best,
   And best of all souls understand
   The very soul of freedom, scanned
 Far off, sought out in darkling quest
   By men at heart unmanned?


 XXIII

 They climb and fall, ensnared, enshrouded,
   By mists of words and toils they set
   To take themselves, till fierce regret
 Grows mad with shame, and all their clouded
   Red skies hang sunless yet.


 XXIV

 But us the sun, not wholly risen
   Nor equal now for all, illumes
   With more of light than cloud that looms;
 Of light that leads forth souls from prison
   And breaks the seals of tombs.


 XXV

 Did not her breasts who reared us rear
   Him who took heaven in hand, and weighed
   Bright world with world in balance laid?
 What Newton's might could make not clear
   Hath Darwin's might not made?


 XXVI

 The forces of the dark dissolve,
   The doorways of the dark are broken:
   The word that casts out night is spoken,
 And whence the springs of things evolve
   Light born of night bears token.


 XXVII

 She, loving light for light's sake only,
   And truth for only truth's, and song
   For song's sake and the sea's, how long
 Hath she not borne the world her lonely
   Witness of right and wrong?


 XXVIII

 From light to light her eyes imperial
   Turn, and require the further light,
   More perfect than the sun's in sight,
 Till star and sun seem all funereal
   Lamps of the vaulted night.


 XXIX

 She gazes till the strenuous soul
   Within the rapture of her eyes
   Creates or bids awake, arise,
 The light she looks for, pure and whole
   And worshipped of the wise.


 XXX

 Such sons are hers, such radiant hands
   Have borne abroad her lamp of old,
   Such mouths of honey-dropping gold
 Have sent across all seas and lands
   Her fame as music rolled.


 XXXI

 As music made of rolling thunder
   That hurls through heaven its heart sublime,
   Its heart of joy, in charging chime,
 So ring the songs that round and under
   Her temple surge and climb.


 XXXII

 A temple not by men's hands builded,
   But moulded of the spirit, and wrought
   Of passion and imperious thought;
 With light beyond all sunlight gilded,
   Whereby the sun seems nought.


 XXXIII

 Thy shrine, our mother, seen for fairer
   Than even thy natural face, made fair
   With kisses of thine April air
 Even now, when spring thy banner-bearer
   Took up thy sign to bear;


 XXXIV

 Thine annual sign from heaven's own arch
   Given of the sun's hand into thine,
   To rear and cheer each wildwood shrine
 But now laid waste by wild-winged March,
   March, mad with wind like wine.


 XXXV

 From all thy brightening downs whereon
   The windy seaward whin-flower shows
   Blossom whose pride strikes pale the rose
 Forth is the golden watchword gone
   Whereat the world's face glows.


 XXXVI

 Thy quickening woods rejoice and ring
   Till earth seems glorious as the sea:
   With yearning love too glad for glee
 The world's heart quivers toward the spring
   As all our hearts toward thee.


 XXXVII

 Thee, mother, thee, our queen, who givest
   Assurance to the heavens most high
   And earth whereon her bondsmen sigh
 That by the sea's grace while thou livest
   Hope shall not wholly die.


 XXXVIII

 That while thy free folk hold the van
   Of all men, and the sea-spray shed
   As dew more heavenly on thy head
 Keeps bright thy face in sight of man,
   Man's pride shall drop not dead.


 XXXIX

 A pride more pure than humblest prayer,
   More wise than wisdom born of doubt,
   Girds for thy sake men's hearts about
 With trust and triumph that despair
   And fear may cast not out.


 XL

 Despair may wring men's hearts, and fear
   Bow down their heads to kiss the dust,
   Where patriot memories rot and rust,
 And change makes faint a nation's cheer,
   And faith yields up her trust.


 XLI

 Not here this year have true men known,
   Not here this year may true men know,
   That brand of shame-compelling woe
 Which bids but brave men shrink or groan
   And lays but honour low.


 XLII

 The strong spring wind blows notes of praise,
   And hallowing pride of heart, and cheer
   Unchanging, toward all true men here
 Who hold the trust of ancient days
   High as of old this year.


 XLIII

 The days that made thee great are dead;
   The days that now must keep thee great
   Lie not in keeping of thy fate;
 In thine they lie, whose heart and head
   Sustain thy charge of state.


 XLIV

 No state so proud, no pride so just,
   The sun, through clouds at sunrise curled
   Or clouds across the sunset whirled,
 Hath sight of, nor has man such trust
   As thine in all the world.


 XLV

 Each hour that sees the sunset's crest
   Make bright thy shores ere day decline
   Sees dawn the sun on shores of thine,
 Sees west as east and east as west
   On thee their sovereign shine.


 XLVI

 The sea's own heart must needs wax proud
   To have borne the world a child like thee.
   What birth of earth might ever be
 Thy sister? Time, a wandering cloud,
   Is sunshine on thy sea.


 XLVII

 Change mars not her; and thee, our mother,
   What change that irks or moves thee mars?
   What shock that shakes? what chance that jars?
 Time gave thee, as he gave none other,
   A station like a star's.


 XLVIII

 The storm that shrieks, the wind that wages
   War with the wings of hopes that climb
   Too high toward heaven in doubt sublime,
 Assail not thee, approved of ages
   The towering crown of time.


 XLIX

 Toward thee this year thy children turning
   With souls uplift of changeless cheer
   Salute with love that casts out fear,
 With hearts for beacons round thee burning,
   The token of this year.


 L

 With just and sacred jubilation
   Let earth sound answer to the sea
   For witness, blown on winds as free,
 How England, how her crowning nation,
   Acclaims this jubilee.




 THE ARMADA

 1588: 


 I

 I

 England, mother born of seamen, daughter fostered of the sea,
 Mother more beloved than all who bear not all their children free,
   Reared and nursed and crowned and cherished by the sea-wind and
   the sun,
   Sweetest land and strongest, face most fair and mightiest heart
   in one,
 Stands not higher than when the centuries known of earth were less
   by three,
   When the strength that struck the whole world pale fell back from
   hers undone.

 II

 At her feet were the heads of her foes bowed down, and the
   strengths of the storm of them stayed,
 And the hearts that were touched not with mercy with terror were
   touched and amazed and affrayed:
   Yea, hearts that had never been molten with pity were molten with
   fear as with flame,
 And the priests of the Godhead whose temple is hell, and his heart
   is of iron and fire,
 And the swordsmen that served and the seamen that sped them, whom
   peril could tame not or tire,
   Were as foam on the winds of the waters of England which tempest
   can tire not or tame.

 III

 They were girded about with thunder, and lightning came forth of
   the rage of their strength,
 And the measure that measures the wings of the storm was the
   breadth of their force and the length:
 And the name of their might was Invincible, covered and clothed
   with the terror of God;
 With his wrath were they winged, with his love were they fired,
   with the speed of his winds were they shod;
 With his soul were they filled, in his trust were they comforted:
   grace was upon them as night,
 And faith as the blackness of darkness: the fume of their balefires
   was fair in his sight,
 The reek of them sweet as a savour of myrrh in his nostrils: the
   world that he made,
 Theirs was it by gift of his servants: the wind, if they spake in
   his name, was afraid,
 And the sun was a shadow before it, the stars were astonished with
   fear of it: fire
 Went up to them, fed with men living, and lit of men's hands for a
   shrine or a pyre;
 And the east and the west wind scattered their ashes abroad, that
   his name should be blest
 Of the tribes of the chosen whose blessings are curses from
   uttermost east unto west.


 II

 I

 Hell for Spain, and heaven for England,--God to God, and man to
   man,--
 Met confronted, light with darkness, life with death: since time
   began,
   Never earth nor sea beheld so great a stake before them set,
   Save when Athens hurled back Asia from the lists wherein they
   met;
 Never since the sands of ages through the glass of history ran
   Saw the sun in heaven a lordlier day than this that lights us
   yet.

 II

 For the light that abides upon England, the glory that rests on her
   godlike name,
 The pride that is love and the love that is faith, a perfume
   dissolved in flame,
   Took fire from the dawn of the fierce July when fleets were
   scattered as foam
 And squadrons as flakes of spray; when galleon and galliass that
   shadowed the sea
 Were swept from her waves like shadows that pass with the clouds
   they fell from, and she
   Laughed loud to the wind as it gave to her keeping the glories of
   Spain and Rome.

 III

 Three hundred summers have fallen as leaves by the storms in their
   season thinned,
 Since northward the war-ships of Spain came sheer up the way of the
   south-west wind:
 Where the citadel cliffs of England are flanked with bastions of
   serpentine,
 Far off to the windward loomed their hulls, an hundred and
   twenty-nine,
 All filled full of the war, full-fraught with battle and charged
   with bale;
 Then store-ships weighted with cannon; and all were an hundred and
   fifty sail.
 The measureless menace of darkness anhungered with hope to prevail
   upon light,
 The shadow of death made substance, the present and visible spirit
   of night,
 Came, shaped as a waxing or waning moon that rose with the fall of
   day,
 To the channel where couches the Lion in guard of the gate of the
   lustrous bay.
 Fair England, sweet as the sea that shields her, and pure as the
   sea from stain,
 Smiled, hearing hardly for scorn that stirred her the menace of
   saintly Spain.


 III

 I

 "They that ride over ocean wide with hempen bridle and horse of
   tree,"
 How shall they in the darkening day of wrath and anguish and fear
   go free?
 How shall these that have curbed the seas not feel his bridle who
   made the sea?

 God shall bow them and break them now: for what is man in the Lord
   God's sight?
 Fear shall shake them, and shame shall break, and all the noon of
   their pride be night:
 These that sinned shall the ravening wind of doom bring under, and
   judgment smite.

 England broke from her neck the yoke, and rent the fetter, and
   mocked the rod:
 Shrines of old that she decked with gold she turned to dust, to the
   dust she trod:
 What is she, that the wind and sea should fight beside her, and war
   with God?

 Lo, the cloud of his ships that crowd her channel's inlet with
   storm sublime,
 Darker far than the tempests are that sweep the skies of her
   northmost clime;
 Huge and dense as the walls that fence the secret darkness of
   unknown time.

 Mast on mast as a tower goes past, and sail by sail as a cloud's
   wing spread;
 Fleet by fleet, as the throngs whose feet keep time with death in
   his dance of dread;
 Galleons dark as the helmsman's bark of old that ferried to hell
   the dead.

 Squadrons proud as their lords, and loud with tramp of soldiers
   and chant of priests;
 Slaves there told by the thousandfold, made fast in bondage as
   herded beasts;
 Lords and slaves that the sweet free waves shall feed on, satiate
   with funeral feasts.

 Nay, not so shall it be, they know; their priests have said it; can
   priesthood lie?
 God shall keep them, their God shall sleep not: peril and evil
   shall pass them by:
 Nay, for these are his children; seas and winds shall bid not his
   children die.

 II

 So they boast them, the monstrous host whose menace mocks at the
   dawn: and here
 They that wait at the wild sea's gate, and watch the darkness of
   doom draw near,
 How shall they in their evil day sustain the strength of their
   hearts for fear?

 Full July in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing
   morns:
 Winds fall mild that of late waxed wild: no presage whispers or
   wails or warns:
 Far to west on the bland sea's breast a sailing crescent uprears
   her horns.

 Seven wide miles the serene sea smiles between them stretching from
   rim to rim:
 Soft they shine, but a darker sign should bid not hope or belief
   wax dim:
 God's are these men, and not the sea's: their trust is set not on
   her but him.

 God's? but who is the God whereto the prayers and incense of these
   men rise?
 What is he, that the wind and sea should fear him, quelled by his
   sunbright eyes?
 What, that men should return again, and hail him Lord of the
   servile skies?

 Hell's own flame at his heavenly name leaps higher and laughs, and
   its gulfs rejoice:
 Plague and death from his baneful breath take life and lighten, and
   praise his choice:
 Chosen are they to devour for prey the tribes that hear not and
   fear his voice.

 Ay, but we that the wind and sea gird round with shelter of storms
   and waves
 Know not him that ye worship, grim as dreams that quicken from dead
   men's graves:
 God is one with the sea, the sun, the land that nursed us, the love
   that saves.

 Love whose heart is in ours, and part of all things noble and all
   things fair;
 Sweet and free as the circling sea, sublime and kind as the
   fostering air;
 Pure of shame as is England's name, whose crowns to come are as
   crowns that were.


 IV

 I

 But the Lord of darkness, the God whose love is a flaming fire,
 The master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire,
 He shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love,
   not hire.

 They shall fetter the wing of the wind whose pinions are plumed
   with foam:
 For now shall thy horn be exalted, and now shall thy bolt strike
   home;
 Yea, now shall thy kingdom come, Lord God of the priests of Rome.

 They shall cast thy curb on the waters, and bridle the waves of the
   sea:
 They shall say to her, Peace, be still: and stillness and peace
   shall be:
 And the winds and the storms shall hear them, and tremble, and
   worship thee.

 Thy breath shall darken the morning, and wither the mounting sun;
 And the daysprings, frozen and fettered, shall know thee, and cease
   to run;
 The heart of the world shall feel thee, and die, and thy will be
   done.

 The spirit of man that would sound thee, and search out causes of
   things,
 Shall shrink and subside and praise thee: and wisdom, with
   plume-plucked wings,
 Shall cower at thy feet and confess thee, that none may fathom thy
   springs.

 The fountains of song that await but the wind of an April to be
 To burst the bonds of the winter, and speak with the sound of a
   sea,
 The blast of thy mouth shall quench them: and song shall be only of
   thee.

 The days that are dead shall quicken, the seasons that were shall
   return;
 And the streets and the pastures of England, the woods that burgeon
   and yearn,
 Shall be whitened with ashes of women and children and men that
   burn.

 For the mother shall burn with the babe sprung forth of her womb in
   fire,
 And bride with bridegroom, and brother with sister, and son with
   sire;
 And the noise of the flames shall be sweet in thine ears as the
   sound of a lyre.

 Yea, so shall thy kingdom be stablished, and so shall the signs of
   it be:
 And the world shall know, and the wind shall speak, and the sun
   shall see,
 That these are the works of thy servants, whose works bear witness
   to thee.

 II

 But the dusk of the day falls fruitless, whose light should have
   lit them on:
 Sails flash through the gloom to shoreward, eclipsed as the sun
   that shone:
 And the west wind wakes with dawn, and the hope that was here is
   gone.

 Around they wheel and around, two knots to the Spaniard's one,
 The wind-swift warriors of England, who shoot as with shafts of the
   sun,
 With fourfold shots for the Spaniard's, that spare not till day be
   done.

 And the wind with the sundown sharpens, and hurtles the ships to
   the lee,
 And Spaniard on Spaniard smites, and shatters, and yields; and we,
 Ere battle begin, stand lords of the battle, acclaimed of the sea.

 And the day sweeps round to the nightward; and heavy and hard the
   waves
 Roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons; and masters and
   slaves
 Reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig
   their graves.

 For the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of
   the seas,
 The graves that gape for their pasture, and laugh, thrilled through
   by the breeze,
 The sweet soft merciless waters, await and are fain of these.

 As the hiss of a Python heaving in menace of doom to be
 They hear through the clear night round them, whose hours are as
   clouds that flee,
 The whisper of tempest sleeping, the heave and the hiss of the sea.

 But faith is theirs, and with faith are they girded and helmed and
   shod:
 Invincible are they, almighty, elect for a sword and a rod;
 Invincible even as their God is omnipotent, infinite, God.

 In him is their strength, who have sworn that his glory shall wax
   not dim:
 In his name are their war-ships hallowed as mightiest of all that
   swim:
 The men that shall cope with these, and conquer, shall cast out
   him.

 In him is the trust of their hearts; the desire of their eyes is
   he;
 The light of their ways, made lightning for men that would fain be
   free:
 Earth's hosts are with them, and with them is heaven: but with us
   is the sea.


 V

 I

 And a day and a night pass over;
   And the heart of their chief swells high;
 For England, the warrior, the rover,
   Whose banners on all winds fly,
 Soul-stricken, he saith, by the shadow of death, holds off him, and
   draws not nigh.

 And the wind and the dawn together
   Make in from the gleaming east:
 And fain of the wild glad weather
   As famine is fain of feast,
 And fain of the fight, forth sweeps in its might the host of the
   Lord's high priest.

 And lightly before the breeze
   The ships of his foes take wing:
 Are they scattered, the lords of the seas?
   Are they broken, the foes of the king?
 And ever now higher as a mounting fire the hopes of the Spaniard
   spring.

 And a windless night comes down:
   And a breezeless morning, bright
 With promise of praise to crown
   The close of the crowning fight,
 Leaps up as the foe's heart leaps, and glows with lustrous rapture
   of light.

 And stinted of gear for battle
   The ships of the sea's folk lie,
 Unwarlike, herded as cattle,
   Six miles from the foeman's eye
 That fastens as flame on the sight of them tame and offenceless,
   and ranged as to die.

 Surely the souls in them quail,
   They are stricken and withered at heart,
 When in on them, sail by sail,
   Fierce marvels of monstrous art,
 Tower darkening on tower till the sea-winds cower crowds down as to
   hurl them apart.

 And the windless weather is kindly,
   And comforts the host in these;
 And their hearts are uplift in them blindly,
   And blindly they boast at ease
 That the next day's fight shall exalt them, and smite with
   destruction the lords of the seas.

 II

 And lightly the proud hearts prattle,
   And lightly the dawn draws nigh,
 The dawn of the doom of the battle
   When these shall falter and fly;
 No day more great in the roll of fate filled ever with fire the
   sky.

 To fightward they go as to feastward,
   And the tempest of ships that drive
 Sets eastward ever and eastward,
   Till closer they strain and strive;
 And the shots that rain on the hulls of Spain are as thunders afire
   and alive.

 And about them the blithe sea smiles
   And flashes to windward and lee
 Round capes and headlands and isles
   That heed not if war there be;
 Round Sark, round Wight, green jewels of light in the ring of the
   golden sea.

 But the men that within them abide
   Are stout of spirit and stark
 As rocks that repel the tide,
   As day that repels the dark;
 And the light bequeathed from their swords unsheathed shines lineal
   on Wight and on Sark.

 And eastward the storm sets ever,
   The storm of the sails that strain
 And follow and close and sever
   And lose and return and gain;
 And English thunder divides in sunder the holds of the ships of
   Spain.

 Southward to Calais, appalled
   And astonished, the vast fleet veers;
 And the skies are shrouded and palled,
   But the moonless midnight hears
 And sees how swift on them drive and drift strange flames that the
   darkness fears.

 They fly through the night from shoreward,
   Heart-stricken till morning break,
 And ever to scourge them forward
   Drives down on them England's Drake,
 And hurls them in as they hurtle and spin and stagger, with storm
   to wake.


 VI

 I

 And now is their time come on them. For eastward they drift and
   reel,
 With the shallows of Flanders ahead, with destruction and havoc
   at heel,
 With God for their comfort only, the God whom they serve; and
   here
 Their Lord, of his great loving-kindness, may revel and make
   good cheer;
   Though ever his lips wax thirstier with drinking, and hotter the
   lusts in him swell;
 For he feeds the thirst that consumes him with blood, and his
   winepress fumes with the reek of hell.

 II

 Fierce noon beats hard on the battle; the galleons that loom to
   the lee
 Bow down, heel over, uplifting their shelterless hulls from the
   sea:
 From scuppers aspirt with blood, from guns dismounted and dumb,
 The signs of the doom they looked for, the loud mute witnesses
   come.
   They press with sunset to seaward for comfort: and shall not they
   find it there?
 O servants of God most high, shall his winds not pass you by, and
   his waves not spare?

 III

 The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his
   fervent lips,
 More keen than a sword's edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the
   plunging ships.
 The pilot is he of their northward flight, their stay and their
   steersman he;
 A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to
   constrain the sea.
 And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand
   as a bird in the toils;
 For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man's,
   whom he slays and spoils.
 And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering
   will,
 The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star
   shine still,
 If haply some light be left them of chance to renew and redeem the
   fray;
 But the will of the black south-wester is lord of the councils of
   war to-day.
 One only spirit it quells not, a splendour undarkened of chance or
   time;
 Be the praise of his foes with Oquendo for ever, a name as a star
   sublime.
 But here what aid in a hero's heart, what help in his hand may be?
 For ever the dark wind whitens and blackens the hollows and heights
   of the sea,
 And galley by galley, divided and desolate, founders; and none
   takes heed,
 Nor foe nor friend, if they perish; forlorn, cast off in their
   uttermost need,
 They sink in the whelm of the waters, as pebbles by children from
   shoreward hurled,
 In the North Sea's waters that end not, nor know they a bourn but
   the bourn of the world.
 Past many a secure unavailable harbour, and many a loud stream's
   mouth,
 Past Humber and Tees and Tyne and Tweed, they fly, scourged on from
   the south,
 And torn by the scourge of the storm-wind that smites as a harper
   smites on a lyre,
 And consumed of the storm as the sacrifice loved of their God is
   consumed with fire,
 And devoured of the darkness as men that are slain in the fires of
   his love are devoured,
 And deflowered of their lives by the storms, as by priests is the
   spirit of life deflowered.
 For the wind, of its godlike mercy, relents not, and hounds them
   ahead to the north,
 With English hunters at heel, till now is the herd of them past the
   Forth,
 All huddled and hurtled seaward; and now need none wage war upon
   these,
 Nor huntsmen follow the quarry whose fall is the pastime sought of
   the seas.
 Day upon day upon day confounds them, with measureless mists that
   swell,
 With drift of rains everlasting and dense as the fumes of ascending
   hell.
 The visions of priest and of prophet beholding his enemies bruised
   of his rod
 Beheld but the likeness of this that is fallen on the faithful, the
   friends of God.
 Northward, and northward, and northward they stagger and shudder
   and swerve and flit,
 Dismantled of masts and of yards, with sails by the fangs of the
   storm-wind split.
 But north of the headland whose name is Wrath, by the wrath or the
   ruth of the sea,
 They are swept or sustained to the westward, and drive through the
   rollers aloof to the lee.
 Some strive yet northward for Iceland, and perish: but some through
   the storm-hewn straits
 That sunder the Shetlands and Orkneys are borne of the breath which
   is God's or fate's:
 And some, by the dawn of September, at last give thanks as for
   stars that smile,
 For the winds have swept them to shelter and sight of the cliffs of
   a Catholic isle.
 Though many the fierce rocks feed on, and many the merciless
   heretic slays,
 Yet some that have laboured to land with their treasure are
   trustful, and give God praise.
 And the kernes of murderous Ireland, athirst with a greed
   everlasting of blood,
 Unslakable ever with slaughter and spoil, rage down as a ravening
   flood,
 To slay and to flay of their shining apparel their brethren whom
   shipwreck spares;
 Such faith and such mercy, such love and such manhood, such hands
   and such hearts are theirs.
 Short shrift to her foes gives England, but shorter doth Ireland to
   friends; and worse
 Fare they that came with a blessing on treason than they that come
   with a curse.
 Hacked, harried, and mangled of axes and skenes, three thousand
   naked and dead
 Bear witness of Catholic Ireland, what sons of what sires at her
   breasts are bred.
 Winds are pitiful, waves are merciful, tempest and storm are kind:
 The waters that smite may spare, and the thunder is deaf, and the
   lightning is blind:
 Of these perchance at his need may a man, though they know it not,
   yet find grace;
 But grace, if another be hardened against him, he gets not at this
   man's face.
 For his ear that hears and his eye that sees the wreck and the wail
   of men,
 And his heart that relents not within him, but hungers, are like as
   the wolf's in his den.
 Worthy are these to worship their master, the murderous Lord of
   lies,
 Who hath given to the pontiff his servant the keys of the pit and
   the keys of the skies.
 Wild famine and red-shod rapine are cruel, and bitter with blood
   are their feasts;
 But fiercer than famine and redder than rapine the hands and the
   hearts of priests.
 God, God bade these to the battle; and here, on a land by his
   servants trod,
 They perish, a lordly blood-offering, subdued by the hands of the
   servants of God.
 These also were fed of his priests with faith, with the milk of his
   word and the wine;
 These too are fulfilled with the spirit of darkness that guided
   their quest divine.
 And here, cast up from the ravening sea on the mild land's merciful
   breast,
 This comfort they find of their fellows in worship; this guerdon is
   theirs of their quest.
 Death was captain, and doom was pilot, and darkness the chart of
   their way;
 Night and hell had in charge and in keeping the host of the foes of
   day.
 Invincible, vanquished, impregnable, shattered, a sign to her foes
   of fear,
 A sign to the world and the stars of laughter, the fleet of the
   Lord lies here.
 Nay, for none may declare the place of the ruin wherein she lies;
 Nay, for none hath beholden the grave whence never a ghost shall
   rise.
 The fleet of the foemen of England hath found not one but a
   thousand graves;
 And he that shall number and name them shall number by name and by
   tale the waves.


 VII

 I

 Sixtus, Pope of the Church whose hope takes flight for heaven to
   dethrone the sun,
 Philip, king that wouldst turn our spring to winter, blasted,
   appalled, undone,
 Prince and priest, let a mourner's feast give thanks to God for
   your conquest won.

 England's heel is upon you: kneel, O priest, O prince, in the dust,
   and cry,
 "Lord, why thus? art thou wroth with us whose faith was great in
   thee, God most high?
 Whence is this, that the serpent's hiss derides us? Lord, can thy
   pledged word lie?

 "God of hell, are its flames that swell quenched now for ever,
   extinct and dead?
 Who shall fear thee? or who shall hear the word thy servants who
   feared thee said?
 Lord, art thou as the dead gods now, whose arm is shortened, whose
   rede is read?

 "Yet we thought it was not for nought thy word was given us, to
   guard and guide:
 Yet we deemed that they had not dreamed who put their trust in
   thee. Hast thou lied?
 God our Lord, was the sacred sword we drew not drawn on thy
   Church's side?

 "England hates thee as hell's own gates; and England triumphs, and
   Rome bows down:
 England mocks at thee; England's rocks cast off thy servants to
   drive and drown:
 England loathes thee; and fame betroths and plights with England
   her faith for crown.

 "Spain clings fast to thee; Spain, aghast with anguish, cries to
   thee; where art thou?
 Spain puts trust in thee; lo, the dust that soils and darkens her
   prostrate brow!
 Spain is true to thy service; who shall raise up Spain for thy
   service now?

 "Who shall praise thee, if none may raise thy servants up, nor
   affright thy foes?
 Winter wanes, and the woods and plains forget the likeness of
   storms and snows:
 So shall fear of thee fade even here: and what shall follow thee no
   man knows."

 Lords of night, who would breathe your blight on April's morning
   and August's noon,
 God your Lord, the condemned, the abhorred, sinks hellward, smitten
   with deathlike swoon:
 Death's own dart in his hateful heart now thrills, and night shall
   receive him soon.

 God the Devil, thy reign of revel is here for ever eclipsed and
   fled:
 God the Liar, everlasting fire lays hold at last on thee, hand and
   head:
 God the Accurst, the consuming thirst that burns thee never shall
   here be fed.

 II

 England, queen of the waves whose green inviolate girdle enrings
   thee round,
 Mother fair as the morning, where is now the place of thy foemen
   found?
 Still the sea that salutes us free proclaims them stricken,
   acclaims thee crowned.

 Times may change, and the skies grow strange with signs of treason
   and fraud and fear:
 Foes in union of strange communion may rise against thee from far
   and near:
 Sloth and greed on thy strength may feed as cankers waxing from
   year to year.

 Yet, though treason and fierce unreason should league and lie and
   defame and smite,
 We that know thee, how far below thee the hatred burns of the sons
   of night,
 We that love thee, behold above thee the witness written of life in
   light.

 Life that shines from thee shows forth signs that none may read not
   but eyeless foes:
 Hate, born blind, in his abject mind grows hopeful now but as
   madness grows:
 Love, born wise, with exultant eyes adores thy glory, beholds and
   glows.

 Truth is in thee, and none may win thee to lie, forsaking the face
   of truth:
 Freedom lives by the grace she gives thee, born again from thy
   deathless youth:
 Faith should fail, and the world turn pale, wert thou the prey of
   the serpent's tooth.

 Greed and fraud, unabashed, unawed, may strive to sting thee at
   heel in vain:
 Craft and fear and mistrust may leer and mourn and murmur and plead
   and plain:
 Thou art thou: and thy sunbright brow is hers that blasted the
   strength of Spain.

 Mother, mother beloved, none other could claim in place of thee
   England's place:
 Earth bears none that beholds the sun so pure of record, so clothed
   with grace:
 Dear our mother, nor son nor brother is thine, as strong or as fair
   of face.

 How shalt thou be abased? or how shall fear take hold of thy heart?
   of thine,
 England, maiden immortal, laden with charge of life and with hopes
   divine?
 Earth shall wither, when eyes turned hither behold not light in her
   darkness shine.

 England, none that is born thy son, and lives, by grace of thy
   glory, free,
 Lives and yearns not at heart and burns with hope to serve as he
   worships thee;
 None may sing thee: the sea-wind's wing beats down our songs as it
   hails the sea.




 TO A SEAMEW


 When I had wings, my brother,
   Such wings were mine as thine:
 Such life my heart remembers
 In all as wild Septembers
 As this when life seems other,
   Though sweet, than once was mine;
 When I had wings, my brother,
   Such wings were mine as thine.

 Such life as thrills and quickens
   The silence of thy flight,
 Or fills thy note's elation
 With lordlier exultation
 Than man's, whose faint heart sickens
   With hopes and fears that blight
 Such life as thrills and quickens
   The silence of thy flight.

 Thy cry from windward clanging
   Makes all the cliffs rejoice;
 Though storm clothe seas with sorrow,
 Thy call salutes the morrow;
 While shades of pain seem hanging
   Round earth's most rapturous voice,
 Thy cry from windward clanging
   Makes all the cliffs rejoice.

 We, sons and sires of seamen,
   Whose home is all the sea,
 What place man may, we claim it;
 But thine--whose thought may name it?
 Free birds live higher than freemen,
   And gladlier ye than we--
 We, sons and sires of seamen,
   Whose home is all the sea.

 For you the storm sounds only
   More notes of more delight
 Than earth's in sunniest weather:
 When heaven and sea together
 Join strengths against the lonely
   Lost bark borne down by night,
 For you the storm sounds only
   More notes of more delight.

 With wider wing, and louder
   Long clarion-call of joy,
 Thy tribe salutes the terror
 Of darkness, wild as error,
 But sure as truth, and prouder
   Than waves with man for toy;
 With wider wing, and louder
   Long clarion-call of joy.

 The wave's wing spreads and flutters,
   The wave's heart swells and breaks;
 One moment's passion thrills it,
 One pulse of power fulfils it
 And ends the pride it utters
   When, loud with life that quakes,
 The wave's wing spreads and flutters,
   The wave's heart swells and breaks.

 But thine and thou, my brother,
   Keep heart and wing more high
 Than aught may scare or sunder;
 The waves whose throats are thunder
 Fall hurtling each on other,
   And triumph as they die;
 But thine and thou, my brother,
   Keep heart and wing more high.

 More high than wrath or anguish,
   More strong than pride or fear,
 The sense or soul half hidden
 In thee, for us forbidden,
 Bids thee nor change nor languish,
   But live thy life as here,
 More high than wrath or anguish,
   More strong than pride or fear.

 We are fallen, even we, whose passion
   On earth is nearest thine;
 Who sing, and cease from flying;
 Who live, and dream of dying:
 Grey time, in time's grey fashion,
   Bids wingless creatures pine:
 We are fallen, even we, whose passion
   On earth is nearest thine.

 The lark knows no such rapture,
   Such joy no nightingale,
 As sways the songless measure
 Wherein thy wings take pleasure:
 Thy love may no man capture,
   Thy pride may no man quail;
 The lark knows no such rapture,
   Such joy no nightingale.

 And we, whom dreams embolden,
   We can but creep and sing
 And watch through heaven's waste hollow
 The flight no sight may follow
 To the utter bourne beholden
   Of none that lack thy wing:
 And we, whom dreams embolden,
   We can but creep and sing.

 Our dreams have wings that falter,
   Our hearts bear hopes that die;
 For thee no dream could better
 A life no fears may fetter,
 A pride no care can alter,
   That wots not whence or why
 Our dreams have wings that falter,
   Our hearts bear hopes that die.

 With joy more fierce and sweeter
   Than joys we deem divine
 Their lives, by time untarnished,
 Are girt about and garnished,
 Who match the wave's full metre
   And drink the wind's wild wine
 With joy more fierce and sweeter
   Than joys we deem divine.

 Ah, well were I for ever,
   Wouldst thou change lives with me,
 And take my song's wild honey,
 And give me back thy sunny
 Wide eyes that weary never,
   And wings that search the sea;
 Ah, well were I for ever,
   Wouldst thou change lives with me.

 Beachy Head: September 1886.




 PAN AND THALASSIUS

 A LYRICAL IDYL


 THALASSIUS

 Pan!


 PAN

 O sea-stray, seed of Apollo,
   What word wouldst thou have with me?
 My ways thou wast fain to follow
   Or ever the years hailed thee
   Man.

   Now
 If August brood on the valleys,
   If satyrs laugh on the lawns,
 What part in the wildwood alleys
   Hast thou with the fleet-foot fauns--
   Thou?

   See!
 Thy feet are a man's--not cloven
   Like these, not light as a boy's:
 The tresses and tendrils inwoven
   That lure us, the lure of them cloys
   Thee.

   Us
 The joy of the wild woods never
   Leaves free of the thirst it slakes:
 The wild love throbs in us ever
   That burns in the dense hot brakes
   Thus.

   Life,
 Eternal, passionate, awless,
   Insatiable, mutable, dear,
 Makes all men's law for us lawless:
   We strive not: how should we fear
   Strife?

   We,
 The birds and the bright winds know not
   Such joys as are ours in the mild
 Warm woodland; joys such as grow not
   In waste green fields of the wild
   Sea.

   No;
 Long since, in the world's wind veering,
   Thy heart was estranged from me:
 Sweet Echo shall yield thee not hearing:
   What have we to do with thee?
   Go.


 THALASSIUS

   Ay!
 Such wrath on thy nostril quivers
   As once in Sicilian heat
 Bade herdsmen quail, and the rivers
   Shrank, leaving a path for thy feet
   Dry?

   Nay,
 Low down in the hot soft hollow
   Too snakelike hisses thy spleen:
 "O sea-stray, seed of Apollo!"
   What ill hast thou heard or seen?
   Say.

   Man
 Knows well, if he hears beside him
   The snarl of thy wrath at noon,
 What evil may soon betide him,
   Or late, if thou smite not soon,
   Pan.

   Me
 The sound of thy flute, that flatters
   The woods as they smile and sigh,
 Charmed fast as it charms thy satyrs,
   Can charm no faster than I
   Thee.

   Fast
 Thy music may charm the splendid
   Wide woodland silence to sleep
 With sounds and dreams of thee blended
   And whispers of waters that creep
   Past.

   Here
 The spell of thee breathes and passes
   And bids the heart in me pause,
 Hushed soft as the leaves and the grasses
   Are hushed if the storm's foot draws
   Near.

   Yet
 The panic that strikes down strangers
   Transgressing thy ways unaware
 Affrights not me nor endangers
   Through dread of thy secret snare
   Set.


 PAN

   Whence
 May man find heart to deride me?
   Who made his face as a star
 To shine as a God's beside me?
   Nay, get thee away from us, far
   Hence.


 THALASSIUS

   Then
 Shall no man's heart, as he raises
   A hymn to thy secret head,
 Wax great with the godhead he praises:
   Thou, God, shalt be like unto dead
   Men.


 PAN

   Grace
 I take not of men's thanksgiving,
   I crave not of lips that live;
 They die, and behold, I am living,
   While they and their dead Gods give
   Place.


 THALASSIUS

   Yea:
 Too lightly the words were spoken
   That mourned or mocked at thee dead:
 But whose was the word, the token,
   The song that answered and said
   Nay?


 PAN

   Whose
 But mine, in the midnight hidden,
   Clothed round with the strength of night
 And mysteries of things forbidden
   For all but the one most bright
   Muse?


 THALASSIUS

   Hers
 Or thine, O Pan, was the token
   That gave back empire to thee
 When power in thy hands lay broken
   As reeds that quake if a bee
   Stirs?


 PAN

   Whom
 Have I in my wide woods need of?
   Urania's limitless eyes
 Behold not mine end, though they read of
   A word that shall speak to the skies
   Doom.


 THALASSIUS

   She
 Gave back to thee kingdom and glory,
   And grace that was thine of yore,
 And life to thy leaves, late hoary
   As weeds cast up from the hoar
   Sea.

   Song
 Can bid faith shine as the morning
   Though light in the world be none:
 Death shrinks if her tongue sound warning,
   Night quails, and beholds the sun
   Strong.


 PAN

   Night
 Bare rule over men for ages
   Whose worship wist not of me
 And gat but sorrows for wages,
   And hardly for tears could see
   Light.

   Call
 No more on the starry presence
   Whose light through the long dark swam:
 Hold fast to the green world's pleasance:
   For I that am lord of it am
   All.


 THALASSIUS

   God,
 God Pan, from the glad wood's portal
   The breaths of thy song blow sweet:
 But woods may be walked in of mortal
   Man's thought, where never thy feet
   Trod.

   Thine
 All secrets of growth and of birth are,
   All glories of flower and of tree,
 Wheresoever the wonders of earth are;
   The words of the spell of the sea
   Mine.




 A BALLAD OF BATH


 Like a queen enchanted who may not laugh or weep,
   Glad at heart and guarded from change and care like ours,
 Girt about with beauty by days and nights that creep
 Soft as breathless ripples that softly shoreward sweep,
   Lies the lovely city whose grace no grief deflowers.
 Age and grey forgetfulness, time that shifts and veers,
 Touch not thee, our fairest, whose charm no rival nears,
   Hailed as England's Florence of one whose praise gives grace,
 Landor, once thy lover, a name that love reveres:
   Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.

 Dawn whereof we know not, and noon whose fruit we reap,
   Garnered up in record of years that fell like flowers,
 Sunset liker sunrise along the shining steep
 Whence thy fair face lightens, and where thy soft springs leap,
   Crown at once and gird thee with grace of guardian powers
 Loved of men beloved of us, souls that fame inspheres,
 All thine air hath music for him who dreams and hears;
   Voices mixed of multitudes, feet of friends that pace,
 Witness why for ever, if heaven's face clouds or clears,
   Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.

 Peace hath here found harbourage mild as very sleep:
   Not the hills and waters, the fields and wildwood bowers,
 Smile or speak more tenderly, clothed with peace more deep,
 Here than memory whispers of days our memories keep
   Fast with love and laughter and dreams of withered hours.
 Bright were these as blossom of old, and thought endears
 Still the fair soft phantoms that pass with smiles or tears,
   Sweet as roseleaves hoarded and dried wherein we trace
 Still the soul and spirit of sense that lives and cheers:
   Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.

 City lulled asleep by the chime of passing years,
 Sweeter smiles thy rest than the radiance round thy peers;
   Only love and lovely remembrance here have place.
 Time on thee lies lighter than music on men's ears;
   Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.




 IN A GARDEN


   Baby, see the flowers!
   --Baby sees
 Fairer things than these,
 Fairer though they be than dreams of ours.

   Baby, hear the birds!
   --Baby knows
 Better songs than those,
 Sweeter though they sound than sweetest words.

   Baby, see the moon!
   --Baby's eyes
 Laugh to watch it rise,
 Answering light with love and night with noon.

   Baby, hear the sea!
   --Baby's face
 Takes a graver grace,
 Touched with wonder what the sound may be.

   Baby, see the star!
   --Baby's hand
 Opens, warm and bland,
 Calm in claim of all things fair that are.

   Baby, hear the bells!
   --Baby's head
 Bows, as ripe for bed,
 Now the flowers curl round and close their cells.

   Baby, flower of light,
   Sleep, and see
 Brighter dreams than we,
 Till good day shall smile away good night.




 A RHYME


 Babe, if rhyme be none
   For that sweet small word
 Babe, the sweetest one
   Ever heard,

 Right it is and meet
   Rhyme should keep not true
 Time with such a sweet
   Thing as you.

 Meet it is that rhyme
   Should not gain such grace:
 What is April's prime
   To your face?

 What to yours is May's
   Rosiest smile? what sound
 Like your laughter sways
   All hearts round?

 None can tell in metre
   Fit for ears on earth
 What sweet star grew sweeter
   At your birth.

 Wisdom doubts what may be:
   Hope, with smile sublime,
 Trusts: but neither, baby,
   Knows the rhyme.

 Wisdom lies down lonely;
   Hope keeps watch from far;
 None but one seer only
   Sees the star.

 Love alone, with yearning
   Heart for astrolabe,
 Takes the star's height, burning
   O'er the babe.




 BABY-BIRD


 Baby-bird, baby-bird,
   Ne'er a song on earth
 May be heard, may be heard,
   Rich as yours in mirth.

 All your flickering fingers,
   All your twinkling toes,
 Play like light that lingers
   Till the clear song close.

 Baby-bird, baby-bird,
   Your grave majestic eyes
 Like a bird's warbled words
   Speak, and sorrow dies.

 Sorrow dies for love's sake,
   Love grows one with mirth,
 Even for one white dove's sake,
   Born a babe on earth.

 Baby-bird, baby-bird,
   Chirping loud and long,
 Other birds hush their words,
   Hearkening toward your song.

 Sweet as spring though it ring,
   Full of love's own lures,
 Weak and wrong sounds their song,
   Singing after yours.

 Baby-bird, baby-bird,
   The happy heart that hears
 Seems to win back within
   Heaven, and cast out fears.

 Earth and sun seem as one
   Sweet light and one sweet word
 Known of none here but one,
   Known of one sweet bird.




 OLIVE


 I

 Who may praise her?
 Eyes where midnight shames the sun,
 Hair of night and sunshine spun,
 Woven of dawn's or twilight's loom,
 Radiant darkness, lustrous gloom,
 Godlike childhood's flowerlike bloom,
 None may praise aright, nor sing
 Half the grace wherewith like spring
 Love arrays her.


 II

 Love untold
 Sings in silence, speaks in light
 Shed from each fair feature, bright
 Still from heaven, whence toward us, now
 Nine years since, she deigned to bow
 Down the brightness of her brow,
 Deigned to pass through mortal birth:
 Reverence calls her, here on earth,
 Nine years old.


 III

 Love's deep duty,
 Even when love transfigured grows
 Worship, all too surely knows
 How, though love may cast out fear,
 Yet the debt divine and dear
 Due to childhood's godhead here
 May by love of man be paid
 Never; never song be made
 Worth its beauty.


 IV

 Nought is all
 Sung or said or dreamed or thought
 Ever, set beside it; nought
 All the love that man may give--
 Love whose prayer should be, "Forgive!"
 Heaven, we see, on earth may live;
 Earth can thank not heaven, we know,
 Save with songs that ebb and flow,
 Rise and fall.


 V

 No man living,
 No man dead, save haply one
 Now gone homeward past the sun,
 Ever found such grace as might
 Tune his tongue to praise aright
 Children, flowers of love and light,
 Whom our praise dispraises: we
 Sing, in sooth, but not as he
 Sang thanksgiving.


 VI

 Hope that smiled,
 Seeing her new-born beauty, made
 Out of heaven's own light and shade,
 Smiled not half so sweetly: love,
 Seeing the sun, afar above,
 Warm the nest that rears the dove,
 Sees, more bright than moon or sun,
 All the heaven of heavens in one
 Little child.


 VII

 Who may sing her?
 Wings of angels when they stir
 Make no music worthy her:
 Sweeter sound her shy soft words
 Here than songs of God's own birds
 Whom the fire of rapture girds
 Round with light from love's face lit;
 Hands of angels find no fit
 Gifts to bring her.


 VIII

 Babes at birth
 Wear as raiment round them cast,
 Keep as witness toward their past,
 Tokens left of heaven; and each,
 Ere its lips learn mortal speech,
 Ere sweet heaven pass on pass reach,
 Bears in undiverted eyes
 Proof of unforgotten skies
 Here on earth.


 IX

 Quenched as embers
 Quenched with flakes of rain or snow
 Till the last faint flame burns low,
 All those lustrous memories lie
 Dead with babyhood gone by:
 Yet in her they dare not die:
 Others, fair as heaven is, yet,
 Now they share not heaven, forget:
 She remembers.




 A WORD WITH THE WIND


 Lord of days and nights that hear thy word of wintry warning,
   Wind, whose feet are set on ways that none may tread,
 Change the nest wherein thy wings are fledged for flight by
   morning,
   Change the harbour whence at dawn thy sails are spread.
 Not the dawn, ere yet the imprisoning night has half released her,
   More desires the sun's full face of cheer, than we,
 Well as yet we love the strength of the iron-tongued north-easter,
   Yearn for wind to meet us as we front the sea.
 All thy ways are good, O wind, and all the world should fester,
   Were thy fourfold godhead quenched, or stilled thy strife:
 Yet the waves and we desire too long the deep south-wester,
   Whence the waters quicken shoreward, clothed with life.
 Yet the field not made for ploughing save of keels nor harrowing
   Save of storm-winds lies unbrightened by thy breath:
 Banded broad with ruddy samphire glow the sea-banks narrowing
   Westward, while the sea gleams chill and still as death.
 Sharp and strange from inland sounds thy bitter note of battle,
   Blown between grim skies and waters sullen-souled,
 Till the baffled seas bear back, rocks roar and shingles rattle,
   Vexed and angered and anhungered and acold.
 Change thy note, and give the waves their will, and all the
   measure,
   Full and perfect, of the music of their might,
 Let it fill the bays with thunderous notes and throbs of pleasure,
   Shake the shores with passion, sound at once and smite.
 Sweet are even the mild low notes of wind and sea, but sweeter
   Sounds the song whose choral wrath of raging rhyme
 Bids the shelving shoals keep tune with storm's imperious metre,
   Bids the rocks and reefs respond in rapturous chime.
 Sweet the lisp and lulling whisper and luxurious laughter,
   Soft as love or sleep, of waves whereon the sun
 Dreams, and dreams not of the darkling hours before nor after,
   Winged with cloud whose wrath shall bid love's day be done.
 Yet shall darkness bring the awakening sea a lordlier lover,
   Clothed with strength more amorous and more strenuous will,
 Whence her heart of hearts shall kindle and her soul recover
   Sense of love too keen to lie for love's sake still.
 Let thy strong south-western music sound, and bid the billows
   Brighten, proud and glad to feel thy scourge and kiss
 Sting and soothe and sway them, bowed as aspens bend or willows,
   Yet resurgent still in breathless rage of bliss.
 All to-day the slow sleek ripples hardly bear up shoreward,
   Charged with sighs more light than laughter, faint and fair,
 Like a woodland lake's weak wavelets lightly lingering forward,
   Soft and listless as the slumber-stricken air.
 Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded,
   Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled,
 Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded,
   Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled.
 Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary,
   Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:
 Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary
   Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred.
 Let thy clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token
   How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:
 Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind's broad wings broken,
   Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine.
 Half the world abhors thee beating back the sea, and blackening
   Heaven with fierce and woful change of fluctuant form:
 All the world acclaims thee shifting sail again, and slackening
   Cloud by cloud the close-reefed cordage of the storm.
 Sweeter fields and brighter woods and lordlier hills than waken
   Here at sunrise never hailed the sun and thee:
 Turn thee then, and give them comfort, shed like rain and shaken
   Far as foam that laughs and leaps along the sea.




 NEAP-TIDE


 Far off is the sea, and the land is afar:
 The low banks reach at the sky,
 Seen hence, and are heavenward high;
 Though light for the leap of a boy they are,
 And the far sea late was nigh.

 The fair wild fields and the circling downs,
 The bright sweet marshes and meads
 All glorious with flowerlike weeds,
 The great grey churches, the sea-washed towns,
 Recede as a dream recedes.

 The world draws back, and the world's light wanes,
 As a dream dies down and is dead;
 And the clouds and the gleams overhead
 Change, and change; and the sea remains,
 A shadow of dreamlike dread.

 Wild, and woful, and pale, and grey,
 A shadow of sleepless fear,
 A corpse with the night for bier,
 The fairest thing that beholds the day
 Lies haggard and hopeless here.

 And the wind's wings, broken and spent, subside;
 And the dumb waste world is hoar,
 And strange as the sea the shore;
 And shadows of shapeless dreams abide
 Where life may abide no more.

 A sail to seaward, a sound from shoreward,
 And the spell were broken that seems
 To reign in a world of dreams
 Where vainly the dreamer's feet make forward
 And vainly the low sky gleams.

 The sea-forsaken forlorn deep-wrinkled
 Salt slanting stretches of sand
 That slope to the seaward hand,
 Were they fain of the ripples that flashed and twinkled
 And laughed as they struck the strand?

 As bells on the reins of the fairies ring
 The ripples that kissed them rang,
 The light from the sundawn sprang,
 And the sweetest of songs that the world may sing
 Was theirs when the full sea sang.

 Now no light is in heaven; and now
 Not a note of the sea-wind's tune
 Rings hither: the bleak sky's boon
 Grants hardly sight of a grey sun's brow--
 A sun more sad than the moon.

 More sad than a moon that clouds beleaguer
 And storm is a scourge to smite,
 The sick sun's shadowlike light
 Grows faint as the clouds and the waves wax eager,
 And withers away from sight.

 The day's heart cowers, and the night's heart quickens:
 Full fain would the day be dead
 And the stark night reign in his stead:
 The sea falls dumb as the sea-fog thickens
 And the sunset dies for dread.

 Outside of the range of time, whose breath
 Is keen as the manslayer's knife
 And his peace but a truce for strife,
 Who knows if haply the shadow of death
 May be not the light of life?

 For the storm and the rain and the darkness borrow
 But an hour from the suns to be,
 But a strange swift passage, that we
 May rejoice, who have mourned not to-day, to-morrow,
 In the sun and the wind and the sea.




 BY THE WAYSIDE


 Summer's face was rosiest, skies and woods were mellow,
 Earth had heaven to friend, and heaven had earth to fellow,
   When we met where wooded hills and meadows meet.
 Autumn's face is pale, and all her late leaves yellow,
   Now that here again we greet.

 Wan with years whereof this eightieth nears December,
   Fair and bright with love, the kind old face I know
 Shines above the sweet small twain whose eyes remember
 Heaven, and fill with April's light this pale November,
   Though the dark year's glass run low.

 Like a rose whose joy of life her silence utters
 When the birds are loud, and low the lulled wind mutters,
   Grave and silent shines the boy nigh three years old.
 Wise and sweet his smile, that falters not nor flutters,
   Glows, and turns the gloom to gold.

 Like the new-born sun's that strikes the dark and slays it,
   So that even for love of light it smiles and dies,
 Laughs the boy's blithe face whose fair fourth year arrays it
 All with light of life and mirth that stirs and sways it
   And fulfils the deep wide eyes.

 Wide and warm with glowing laughter's exultation,
 Full of welcome, full of sunbright jubilation,
   Flash my taller friend's quick eyebeams, charged with glee;
 But with softer still and sweeter salutation
   Shine my smaller friend's on me.

 Little arms flung round my bending neck, that yoke it
   Fast in tender bondage, draw my face down too
 Toward the flower-soft face whose dumb deep smiles invoke it;
 Dumb, but love can read the radiant eyes that woke it,
   Blue as June's mid heaven is blue.

 How may men find refuge, how should hearts be shielded,
 From the weapons thus by little children wielded,
   When they lift such eyes as light this lustrous face--
 Eyes that woke love sleeping unawares, and yielded
   Love for love, a gift of grace,

 Grace beyond man's merit, love that laughs, forgiving
   Even the sin of being no more a child, nor worth
 Trust and love that lavish gifts above man's giving,
 Touch or glance of eyes and lips the sweetest living,
   Fair as heaven and kind as earth?




 NIGHT


 I

 FROM THE ITALIAN OF GIOVANNI STROZZI

 Night, whom in shape so sweet thou here may'st see
   Sleeping, was by an Angel sculptured thus
   In marble, and since she sleeps hath life like us:
 Thou doubt'st? Awake her: she will speak to thee.


 II

 FROM THE ITALIAN OF MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI

 Sleep likes me well, and better yet to know
   I am but stone. While shame and grief must be,
   Good hap is mine, to feel not, nor to see:
 Take heed, then, lest thou wake me: ah, speak low.




 IN TIME OF MOURNING


 "Return," we dare not as we fain
   Would cry from hearts that yearn:
 Love dares not bid our dead again
   Return.

   O hearts that strain and burn
 As fires fast fettered burn and strain!
   Bow down, lie still, and learn.

 The heart that healed all hearts of pain
   No funeral rites inurn:
 Its echoes, while the stars remain,
   Return.

 May 1885.




 THE INTERPRETERS


 I

 Days dawn on us that make amends for many
Sometimes,
 When heaven and earth seem sweeter even than any
Man's rhymes.

 Light had not all been quenched in France, or quelled
In Greece,
 Had Homer sung not, or had Hugo held
His peace.

 Had Sappho's self not left her word thus long
For token,
 The sea round Lesbos yet in waves of song
Had spoken.


 II

 And yet these days of subtler air and finer
Delight,
 When lovelier looks the darkness, and diviner
The light--

 The gift they give of all these golden hours,
Whose urn
 Pours forth reverberate rays or shadowing showers
In turn--

 Clouds, beams, and winds that make the live day's track
Seem living--
 What were they did no spirit give them back
Thanksgiving?


 III

 Dead air, dead fire, dead shapes and shadows, telling
Time nought;
 Man gives them sense and soul by song, and dwelling
In thought.

 In human thought their being endures, their power
Abides:
 Else were their life a thing that each light hour
Derides.

 The years live, work, sigh, smile, and die, with all
They cherish;
 The soul endures, though dreams that fed it fall
And perish.


 IV

 In human thought have all things habitation;
Our days
 Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station
That stays.

 But thought and faith are mightier things than time
Can wrong,
 Made splendid once with speech, or made sublime
By song.

 Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls
Wax hoary,
 Gives earth and heaven, for song's sake and the soul's,
Their glory.

 July 16, 1885.




 THE RECALL


 Return, they cry, ere yet your day
   Set, and the sky grow stern:
 Return, strayed souls, while yet ye may
   Return.

   But heavens beyond us yearn;
 Yea, heights of heaven above the sway
   Of stars that eyes discern.

 The soul whose wings from shoreward stray
   Makes toward her viewless bourne
 Though trustless faith and unfaith say,
   Return.




 BY TWILIGHT


 If we dream that desire of the distance above us
 Should be fettered by fear of the shadows that seem,
 If we wake, to be nought, but to hate or to love us
 If we dream,

 Night sinks on the soul, and the stars as they gleam
 Speak menace or mourning, with tongues to reprove us
 That we deemed of them better than terror may deem.

 But if hope may not lure us, if fear may not move us,
 Thought lightens the darkness wherein the supreme
 Pure presence of death shall assure us, and prove us
 If we dream.




 A BABY'S EPITAPH


 April made me: winter laid me here away asleep.
 Bright as Maytime was my daytime; night is soft and deep:
 Though the morrow bring forth sorrow, well are ye that weep.

 Ye that held me dear beheld me not a twelvemonth long:
 All the while ye saw me smile, ye knew not whence the song
 Came that made me smile, and laid me here, and wrought you wrong.

 Angels, calling from your brawling world one undefiled,
 Homeward bade me, and forbade me here to rest beguiled:
 Here I sleep not: pass, and weep not here upon your child.




 ON THE DEATH OF SIR HENRY TAYLOR


 Fourscore and five times has the gradual year
   Risen and fulfilled its days of youth and eld
   Since first the child's eyes opening first beheld
 Light, who now leaves behind to help us here
 Light shed from song as starlight from a sphere
   Serene as summer; song whose charm compelled
   The sovereign soul made flesh in Artevelde
 To stand august before us and austere,
 Half sad with mortal knowledge, all sublime
 With trust that takes no taint from change or time,
 Trust in man's might of manhood. Strong and sage,
   Clothed round with reverence of remembering hearts,
 He, twin-born with our nigh departing age,
   Into the light of peace and fame departs.




 IN MEMORY OF JOHN WILLIAM INCHBOLD


 Farewell: how should not such as thou fare well,
   Though we fare ill that love thee, and that live,
 And know, whate'er the days wherein we dwell
   May give us, thee again they will not give?

 Peace, rest, and sleep are all we know of death,
   And all we dream of comfort: yet for thee,
 Whose breath of life was bright and strenuous breath,
   We think the change is other than we see.

 The seal of sleep set on thine eyes to-day
   Surely can seal not up the keen swift light
 That lit them once for ever. Night can slay
   None save the children of the womb of night.

 The fire that burns up dawn to bring forth noon
   Was father of thy spirit: how shouldst thou
 Die as they die for whom the sun and moon
   Are silent? Thee the darkness holds not now:

 Them, while they looked upon the light, and deemed
   That life was theirs for living in the sun,
 The darkness held in bondage: and they dreamed,
   Who knew not that such life as theirs was none.

 To thee the sun spake, and the morning sang
   Notes deep and clear as life or heaven: the sea
 That sounds for them but wild waste music rang
   Notes that were lost not when they rang for thee.

 The mountains clothed with light and night and change,
   The lakes alive with wind and cloud and sun,
 Made answer, by constraint sublime and strange,
   To the ardent hand that bade thy will be done.

 We may not bid the mountains mourn, the sea
   That lived and lightened from thine hand again
 Moan, as of old would men that mourned as we
   A man beloved, a man elect of men,

 A man that loved them. Vain, divine and vain,
   The dream that touched with thoughts or tears of ours
 The spirit of sense that lives in sun and rain,
   Sings out in birds, and breathes and fades in flowers.

 Not for our joy they live, and for our grief
   They die not. Though thine eye be closed, thine hand
 Powerless as mine to paint them, not a leaf
   In English woods or glades of Switzerland

 Falls earlier now, fades faster. All our love
   Moves not our mother's changeless heart, who gives
 A little light to eyes and stars above,
   A little life to each man's heart that lives.

 A little life to heaven and earth and sea,
   To stars and souls revealed of night and day,
 And change, the one thing changeless: yet shall she
   Cease too, perchance, and perish. Who shall say?

 Our mother Nature, dark and sweet as sleep,
   And strange as life and strong as death, holds fast,
 Even as she holds our hearts alive, the deep
   Dumb secret of her first-born births and last.

 But this, we know, shall cease not till the strife
   Of nights and days and fears and hopes find end;
 This, through the brief eternities of life,
   Endures, and calls from death a living friend;

 The love made strong with knowledge, whence confirmed
   The whole soul takes assurance, and the past
 (So by time's measure, not by memory's, termed)
   Lives present life, and mingles first with last.

 I, now long since thy guest of many days,
   Who found thy hearth a brother's, and with thee
 Tracked in and out the lines of rolling bays
   And banks and gulfs and reaches of the sea--

 Deep dens wherein the wrestling water sobs
   And pants with restless pain of refluent breath
 Till all the sunless hollow sounds and throbs
   With ebb and flow of eddies dark as death--

 I know not what more glorious world, what waves
   More bright with life,--if brighter aught may live
 Than those that filled and fled their tidal caves--
   May now give back the love thou hast to give.

 Tintagel, and the long Trebarwith sand,
   Lone Camelford, and Boscastle divine
 With dower of southern blossom, bright and bland
   Above the roar of granite-baffled brine,

 Shall hear no more by joyous night or day
   From downs or causeways good to rove and ride
 Or feet of ours or horse-hoofs urge their way
   That sped us here and there by tower and tide.

 The headlands and the hollows and the waves,
   For all our love, forget us: where I am
 Thou art not: deeper sleeps the shadow on graves
   Than in the sunless gulf that once we swam.

 Thou hast swum too soon the sea of death: for us
   Too soon, but if truth bless love's blind belief
 Faith, born of hope and memory, says not thus:
   And joy for thee for me should mean not grief.

 And joy for thee, if ever soul of man
   Found joy in change and life of ampler birth
 Than here pens in the spirit for a span,
   Must be the life that doubt calls death on earth.

 For if, beyond the shadow and the sleep,
   A place there be for souls without a stain,
 Where peace is perfect, and delight more deep
   Than seas or skies that change and shine again,

 There none of all unsullied souls that live
   May hold a surer station: none may lend
 More light to hope's or memory's lamp, nor give
   More joy than thine to those that called thee friend.

 Yea, joy from sorrow's barren womb is born
   When faith begets on grief the godlike child:
 As midnight yearns with starry sense of morn
   In Arctic summers, though the sea wax wild,

 So love, whose name is memory, thrills at heart,
   Remembering and rejoicing in thee, now
 Alive where love may dream not what thou art
   But knows that higher than hope or love art thou.

 "Whatever heaven, if heaven at all may be,
   Await the sacred souls of good men dead,
 There, now we mourn who loved him here, is he,"
   So, sweet and stern of speech, the Roman said,

 Erect in grief, in trust erect, and gave
   His deathless dead a deathless life even here
 Where day bears down on day as wave on wave
   And not man's smile fades faster than his tear.

 Albeit this gift be given not me to give,
   Nor power be mine to break time's silent spell,
 Not less shall love that dies not while I live
   Bid thee, beloved in life and death, farewell.




 NEW YEAR'S DAY


 New Year, be good to England. Bid her name
   Shine sunlike as of old on all the sea:
   Make strong her soul: set all her spirit free:
 Bind fast her homeborn foes with links of shame
 More strong than iron and more keen than flame:
   Seal up their lips for shame's sake: so shall she
   Who was the light that lightened freedom be,
 For all false tongues, in all men's eyes the same.

 O last-born child of Time, earth's eldest lord,
   God undiscrowned of godhead, who for man
 Begets all good and evil things that live,
 Do thou, his new-begotten son, implored
   Of hearts that hope and fear not, make thy span
 Bright with such light as history bids thee give.


 Jan. 1, 1889.




 TO SIR RICHARD F. BURTON

 (ON HIS TRANSLATION OF "THE ARABIAN NIGHTS")


 Westward the sun sinks, grave and glad; but far
   Eastward, with laughter and tempestuous tears,
 Cloud, rain, and splendour as of orient spears,
 Keen as the sea's thrill toward a kindling star,
 The sundawn breaks the barren twilight's bar
   And fires the mist and slays it. Years on years
   Vanish, but he that hearkens eastward hears
 Bright music from the world where shadows are.

 Where shadows are not shadows. Hand in hand
 A man's word bids them rise and smile and stand
   And triumph. All that glorious orient glows
 Defiant of the dusk. Our twilight land
   Trembles; but all the heaven is all one rose,
   Whence laughing love dissolves her frosts and snows.




 NELL GWYN


 Sweet heart, that no taint of the throne or the stage
   Could touch with unclean transformation, or alter
   To the likeness of courtiers whose consciences falter
 At the smile or the frown, at the mirth or the rage,
 Of a master whom chance could inflame or assuage,
   Our Lady of Laughter, invoked in no psalter,
   Adored of no faithful that cringe and that palter,
 Praise be with thee yet from a hag-ridden age.

 Our Lady of Pity thou wast: and to thee
 All England, whose sons are the sons of the sea,
   Gives thanks, and will hear not if history snarls
 When the name of the friend of her sailors is spoken;
 And thy lover she cannot but love--by the token
   That thy name was the last on the lips of King Charles.




 CALIBAN ON ARIEL

 "His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract"


 The tongue is loosed of that most lying slave,
   Whom stripes may move, not kindness. Listen: "Lo,
   The real god of song, Lord Stephano,
 That's a brave god, if ever god were brave,
 And bears celestial liquor: but," the knave
   (A most ridiculous monster) howls, "we know
   From Ariel's lips what springs of poison flow,
 The chicken-heart blasphemer! Hear him rave!"

 Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
   Upon thy wicked dam, the witch whose name
 Is darkness, and the sun her eyes' offence,
 Though hell's hot sewerage breed no loathlier elf,
   Men cry not shame upon thee, seeing thy shame
 So perfect: they but bid thee--"Hag-seed, hence!"




 THE WEARY WEDDING


 O daughter, why do ye laugh and weep,
 One with another?
 For woe to wake and for will to sleep,
 Mother, my mother.

 But weep ye winna the day ye wed,
 One with another.
 For tears are dry when the springs are dead,
 Mother, my mother.

 Too long have your tears run down like rain,
 One with another.
 For a long love lost and a sweet love slain,

 Too long have your tears dripped down like dew,

 Let past things perish and dead griefs lie,

 And what will ye give your blithe bridesmaid?
 One with another.

 And what will ye drink the day ye're wed?
 One with another.
 But ae drink of the wan well-head,
 Mother, my mother.

 And whatten a water is that to draw?
 One with another.
 We maun draw thereof a', we maun drink thereof a',
 Mother, my mother.

 And what shall ye pu' where the well rins deep?
 One with another.
 Green herb of death, fine flower of sleep,
 Mother, my mother.

 Are there ony fishes that swim therein?
 One with another.
 The white fish grace, and the red fish sin,
 Mother, my mother.

 Are there ony birds that sing thereby?
 One with another.
 O when they come thither they sing till they die,
 Mother, my mother.

 Is there ony draw-bucket to that well-head?
 One with another.
 There's a wee well-bucket hangs low by a thread,
 Mother, my mother.

 And whatten a thread is that to spin?
 One with another.
 It's green for grace, and it's black for sin,
 Mother, my mother.

 And what will ye strew on your bride-chamber floor?
 One with another.
 But one strewing and no more,
 Mother, my mother.

 And whatten a strewing shall that one be?
 One with another.
 The dust of earth and sand of the sea,
 Mother, my mother.

 And what will ye take to build your bed?
 One with another.
 Sighing and shame and the bones of the dead,
 Mother, my mother.

 And what will ye wear for your wedding gown?

 And what will ye wear for your wedding lace?

 Wedded in white and buried in black,
 Mother, my mother.

 The world's day and the world's night,
 One with another,
 Wedded in black and buried in white,
 Mother, my mother.

 The world's bliss and the world's teen,
 One with another,
 It's red for white and it's black for green,
 Mother, my mother.

 The world's will and the world's way,
 One with another,
 It's sighing for night and crying for day,
 Mother, my mother.

 The world's good and the world's worth,
 One with another,
 It's earth to flesh and it's flesh to earth,
 Mother, my mother.



 When she came out at the kirkyard gate,
 (One with another)
 The bridegroom's mother was there in wait.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 O mother, where is my great green bed,
 (One with another)
 Silk at the foot and gold at the head,
 Mother, my mother?

 Yea, it is ready, the silk and the gold,
 One with another.
 But line it well that I lie not cold,
 Mother, my mother.

 She laid her cheek to the velvet and vair,
 One with another;
 She laid her arms up under her hair.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Her gold hair fell through her arms fu' low,
 One with another:
 Lord God, bring me out of woe!
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Her gold hair fell in the gay reeds green,
 One with another:
 Lord God, bring me out of teen!
 (Mother, my mother.)



 O mother, where is my lady gone?
 (One with another.)
 In the bride-chamber she makes sore moan:
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Her hair falls over the velvet and vair,
 (One with another)
 Her great soft tears fall over her hair.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 When he came into the bride's chamber,
 (One with another)
 Her hands were like pale yellow amber.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Her tears made specks in the velvet and vair,
 (One with another)
 The seeds of the reeds made specks in her hair.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 He kissed her under the gold on her head;
 (One with another)
 The lids of her eyes were like cold lead.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 He kissed her under the fall of her chin;
 (One with another)
 There was right little blood therein.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 He kissed her under her shoulder sweet;
 (One with another)
 Her throat was weak, with little heat.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 He kissed her down by her breast-flowers red,
 One with another;
 They were like river-flowers dead.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 What ails you now o' your weeping, wife?
 (One with another.)
 It ails me sair o' my very life.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 What ails you now o' your weary ways?
 (One with another.)
 It ails me sair o' my long life-days.
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Nay, ye are young, ye are over fair.
 (One with another.)
 Though I be young, what needs ye care?
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Nay, ye are fair, ye are over sweet.
 (One with another.)
 Though I be fair, what needs ye greet?
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Nay, ye are mine while I hold my life.
 (One with another.)
 O fool, will ye marry the worm for a wife?
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Nay, ye are mine while I have my breath.
 (One with another.)
 O fool, will ye marry the dust of death?
 (Mother, my mother.)

 Yea, ye are mine, we are handfast wed,
 One with another.
 Nay, I am no man's; nay, I am dead,
 Mother, my mother.




 THE WINDS


 O weary fa' the east wind,
   And weary fa' the west:
 And gin I were under the wan waves wide
   I wot weel wad I rest.

 O weary fa' the north wind,
   And weary fa' the south:
 The sea went ower my good lord's head
   Or ever he kissed my mouth.

 Weary fa' the windward rocks,
   And weary fa' the lee:
 They might hae sunken sevenscore ships,
   And let my love's gang free.

 And weary fa' ye, mariners a',
   And weary fa' the sea:
 It might hae taken an hundred men,
   And let my ae love be.




 A LYKE-WAKE SONG


 Fair of face, full of pride,
 Sit ye down by a dead man's side.

 Ye sang songs a' the day:
 Sit down at night in the red worm's way.

 Proud ye were a' day long:
 Ye'll be but lean at evensong.

 Ye had gowd kells on your hair:
 Nae man kens what ye were.

 Ye set scorn by the silken stuff:
 Now the grave is clean enough.

 Ye set scorn by the rubis ring:
 Now the worm is a saft sweet thing.

 Fine gold and blithe fair face,
 Ye are come to a grimly place.

 Gold hair and glad grey een,
 Nae man kens if ye have been.




 A REIVER'S NECK-VERSE


 Some die singing, and some die swinging,
   And weel mot a' they be:
 Some die playing, and some die praying,
   And I wot sae winna we, my dear,
   And I wot sae winna we.

 Some die sailing, and some die wailing,
   And some die fair and free:
 Some die flyting, and some die fighting,
   But I for a fause love's fee, my dear,
   But I for a fause love's fee.

 Some die laughing, and some die quaffing,
   And some die high on tree:
 Some die spinning, and some die sinning,
   But faggot and fire for ye, my dear,
   Faggot and fire for ye.

 Some die weeping, and some die sleeping,
   And some die under sea:
 Some die ganging, and some die hanging,
   And a twine of a tow for me, my dear,
   A twine of a tow for me.




 THE WITCH-MOTHER


 "O where will ye gang to and where will ye sleep,
   Against the night begins?"
 "My bed is made wi' cauld sorrows,
   My sheets are lined wi' sins.

 "And a sair grief sitting at my foot,
   And a sair grief at my head;
 And dule to lay me my laigh pillows,
   And teen till I be dead.

 "And the rain is sair upon my face,
   And sair upon my hair;
 And the wind upon my weary mouth,
   That never may man kiss mair.

 "And the snow upon my heavy lips,
   That never shall drink nor eat;
 And shame to cledding, and woe to wedding,
   And pain to drink and meat.

 "But woe be to my bairns' father,
   And ever ill fare he:
 He has tane a braw bride hame to him,
   Cast out my bairns and me."

 "And what shall they have to their marriage meat
   This day they twain are wed?"
 "Meat of strong crying, salt of sad sighing,
   And God restore the dead."

 "And what shall they have to their wedding wine
   This day they twain are wed?"
 "Wine of weeping, and draughts of sleeping,
   And God raise up the dead."

 She's tane her to the wild woodside,
   Between the flood and fell:
 She's sought a rede against her need
   Of the fiend that bides in hell.

 She's tane her to the wan burnside,
   She's wrought wi' sang and spell:
 She's plighted her soul for doom and dole
   To the fiend that bides in hell.

 She's set her young son to her breast,
   Her auld son to her knee:
 Says, "Weel for you the night, bairnies,
   And weel the morn for me."

 She looked fu' lang in their een, sighing,
   And sair and sair grat she:
 She has slain her young son at her breast,
   Her auld son at her knee.

 She's sodden their flesh wi' saft water,
   She's mixed their blood with wine:
 She's tane her to the braw bride-house,
   Where a' were boun' to dine.

 She poured the red wine in his cup,
   And his een grew fain to greet:
 She set the baked meats at his hand,
   And bade him drink and eat.

 Says, "Eat your fill of your flesh, my lord,
   And drink your fill of your wine;
 For a' thing's yours and only yours
   That has been yours and mine."

 Says, "Drink your fill of your wine, my lord,
   And eat your fill of your bread:
 I would they were quick in my body again,
   Or I that bare them dead."

 He struck her head frae her fair body,
   And dead for grief he fell:
 And there were twae mair sangs in heaven,
   And twae mair sauls in hell.




 THE BRIDE'S TRAGEDY


 "The wind wears roun', the day wears doun,
   The moon is grisly grey;
 There's nae man rides by the mirk muirsides,
   Nor down the dark Tyne's way."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "And winna ye watch the night wi' me,
   And winna ye wake the morn?
 Foul shame it were that your ae mither
   Should brook her ae son's scorn."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "O mither, I may not sleep nor stay,
   My weird is ill to dree;
 For a fause faint lord of the south seaboard
   Wad win my bride of me."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "The winds are strang, and the nights are lang,
   And the ways are sair to ride:
 And I maun gang to wreak my wrang,
   And ye maun bide and bide."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "Gin I maun bide and bide, Willie,
   I wot my weird is sair:
 Weel may ye get ye a light love yet,
   But never a mither mair."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "O gin the morrow be great wi' sorrow,
   The wyte be yours of a':
 But though ye slay me that haud and stay me,
   The weird ye will maun fa'."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 When cocks were crawing and day was dawing,
   He's boun' him forth to ride:
 And the ae first may he's met that day
   Was fause Earl Robert's bride.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 O blithe and braw were the bride-folk a',
   But sad and saft rade she;
 And sad as doom was her fause bridegroom,
   But fair and fain was he.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "And winna ye bide, sae saft ye ride,
   And winna ye speak wi' me?
 For mony's the word and the kindly word
   I have spoken aft wi' thee."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "My lamp was lit yestreen, Willie,
   My window-gate was wide:
 But ye camena nigh me till day came by me
   And made me not your bride."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 He's set his hand to her bridle-rein,
   He's turned her horse away:
 And the cry was sair, and the wrath was mair,
   And fast and fain rode they.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 But when they came by Chollerford,
   I wot the ways were fell;
 For broad and brown the spate swang down,
   And the lift was mirk as hell.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "And will ye ride yon fell water,
   Or will ye bide for fear?
 Nae scathe ye'll win o' your father's kin,
   Though they should slay me here."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "I had liefer ride yon fell water,
   Though strange it be to ride,
 Than I wad stand on the fair green strand
   And thou be slain beside."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "I had liefer swim yon wild water,
   Though sair it be to bide,
 Than I wad stand at a strange man's hand,
   To be a strange man's bride."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 "I had liefer drink yon dark water,
   Wi' the stanes to make my bed,
 And the faem to hide me, and thou beside me,
   Than I wad see thee dead."
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 He's kissed her twice, he's kissed her thrice,
   On cheek and lip and chin:
 He's wound her rein to his hand again,
   And lightly they leapt in.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 Their hearts were high to live or die,
   Their steeds were stark of limb:
 But the stream was starker, the spate was darker,
   Than man might live and swim.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 The first ae step they strode therein,
   It smote them foot and knee:
 But ere they wan to the mid water
   The spate was as the sea.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.

 But when they wan to the mid water,
   It smote them hand and head:
 And nae man knows but the wave that flows
   Where they lie drowned and dead.
 In, in, out and in,
 Blaws the wind and whirls the whin.




 A JACOBITE'S FAREWELL

 


 There's nae mair lands to tyne, my dear,
   And nae mair lives to gie:
 Though a man think sair to live nae mair,
   There's but one day to die.

 For a' things come and a' days gane,
   What needs ye rend your hair?
 But kiss me till the morn's morrow,
   Then I'll kiss ye nae mair.

 O lands are lost and life's losing,
   And what were they to gie?
 Fu' mony a man gives all he can,
   But nae man else gives ye.

 Our king wons ower the sea's water,
   And I in prison sair:
 But I'll win out the morn's morrow,
   And ye'll see me nae mair.




 A JACOBITE'S EXILE

 


 The weary day rins down and dies,
   The weary night wears through:
 And never an hour is fair wi' flower,
   And never a flower wi' dew.

 I would the day were night for me,
   I would the night were day:
 For then would I stand in my ain fair land,
   As now in dreams I may.

 O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,
   And loud the dark Durance:
 But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne
   Than a' the fields of France;
 And the waves of Till that speak sae still
   Gleam goodlier where they glance.

 O weel were they that fell fighting
   On dark Drumossie's day:
 They keep their hame ayont the faem,
   And we die far away.

 O sound they sleep, and saft, and deep,
   But night and day wake we;
 And ever between the sea-banks green
   Sounds loud the sundering sea.

 And ill we sleep, sae sair we weep,
   But sweet and fast sleep they;
 And the mool that haps them roun' and laps them
   Is e'en their country's clay;
 But the land we tread that are not dead
   Is strange as night by day.

 Strange as night in a strange man's sight,
   Though fair as dawn it be:
 For what is here that a stranger's cheer
   Should yet wax blithe to see?

 The hills stand steep, the dells lie deep,
   The fields are green and gold:
 The hill-streams sing, and the hill-sides ring,
   As ours at home of old.

 But hills and flowers are nane of ours,
   And ours are oversea:
 And the kind strange land whereon we stand,
   It wotsna what were we
 Or ever we came, wi' scathe and shame,
   To try what end might be.

 Scathe, and shame, and a waefu' name,
   And a weary time and strange,
 Have they that seeing a weird for dreeing
   Can die, and cannot change.

 Shame and scorn may we thole that mourn,
   Though sair be they to dree:
 But ill may we bide the thoughts we hide,
   Mair keen than wind and sea.

 Ill may we thole the night's watches,
   And ill the weary day:
 And the dreams that keep the gates of sleep,
   A waefu' gift gie they;
 For the sangs they sing us, the sights they bring us,
   The morn blaws all away.

 On Aikenshaw the sun blinks braw,
   The burn rins blithe and fain:
 There's nought wi' me I wadna gie
   To look thereon again.

 On Keilder-side the wind blaws wide;
   There sounds nae hunting-horn
 That rings sae sweet as the winds that beat
   Round banks where Tyne is born.

 The Wansbeck sings with all her springs,
   The bents and braes give ear;
 But the wood that rings wi' the sang she sings
   I may not see nor hear;
 For far and far thae blithe burns are,
   And strange is a' thing near.

 The light there lightens, the day there brightens,
   The loud wind there lives free:
 Nae light comes nigh me or wind blaws by me
   That I wad hear or see.

 But O gin I were there again,
   Afar ayont the faem,
 Cauld and dead in the sweet saft bed
   That haps my sires at hame!

 We'll see nae mair the sea-banks fair,
   And the sweet grey gleaming sky,
 And the lordly strand of Northumberland,
   And the goodly towers thereby:
 And none shall know but the winds that blow
   The graves wherein we lie.




 THE TYNESIDE WIDOW


 There's mony a man loves land and life,
   Loves life and land and fee;
 And mony a man loves fair women,
   But never a man loves me, my love,
   But never a man loves me.

 O weel and weel for a' lovers,
   I wot weel may they be;
 And weel and weel for a' fair maidens,
   But aye mair woe for me, my love,
   But aye mair woe for me.

 O weel be wi' you, ye sma' flowers,
   Ye flowers and every tree;
 And weel be wi' you, a' birdies,
   But teen and tears wi' me, my love,
   But teen and tears wi' me.

 O weel be yours, my three brethren,
   And ever weel be ye;
 Wi' deeds for doing and loves for wooing,
   But never a love for me, my love,
   But never a love for me.

 And weel be yours, my seven sisters,
   And good love-days to see,
 And long life-days and true lovers,
   But never a day for me, my love,
   But never a day for me.

 Good times wi' you, ye bauld riders,
   By the hieland and the lee;
 And by the leeland and by the hieland
   It's weary times wi' me, my love,
   It's weary times wi' me.

 Good days wi' you, ye good sailors,
   Sail in and out the sea;
 And by the beaches and by the reaches
   It's heavy days wi' me, my love,
   It's heavy days wi' me.

 I had his kiss upon my mouth,
   His bairn upon my knee;
 I would my soul and body were twain,
   And the bairn and the kiss wi' me, my love,
   And the bairn and the kiss wi' me.

 The bairn down in the mools, my dear,
   O saft and saft lies she;
 I would the mools were ower my head,
   And the young bairn fast wi' me, my love,
   And the young bairn fast wi' me.

 The father under the faem, my dear,
   O sound and sound sleeps he;
 I would the faem were ower my face,
   And the father lay by me, my love,
   And the father lay by me.

 I would the faem were ower my face,
   Or the mools on my ee-bree;
 And waking-time with a' lovers,
   But sleeping-time wi' me, my love,
   But sleeping-time wi' me.

 I would the mools were meat in my mouth,
   The saut faem in my ee;
 And the land-worm and the water-worm
   To feed fu' sweet on me, my love,
   To feed fu' sweet on me.

 My life is sealed with a seal of love,
   And locked with love for a key;
 And I lie wrang and I wake lang,
   But ye tak' nae thought for me, my love,
   But ye tak' nae thought for me.

 We were weel fain of love, my dear,
   O fain and fain were we;
 It was weel with a' the weary world,
   But O, sae weel wi' me, my love,
   But O, sae weel wi' me.

 We were nane ower mony to sleep, my dear,
   I wot we were but three;
 And never a bed in the weary world
   For my bairn and my dear and me, my love,
   For my bairn and my dear and me.




 DEDICATION


 The years are many, the changes more,
 Since wind and sun on the wild sweet shore
   Where Joyous Gard stands stark by the sea
 With face as bright as in years of yore

 Shone, swept, and sounded, and laughed for glee
 More deep than a man's or a child's may be,
   On a day when summer was wild and glad,
 And the guests of the wind and the sun were we.

 The light that lightens from seasons clad
 With darkness now, is it glad or sad?
   Not sad but glad should it shine, meseems,
 On eyes yet fain of the joy they had.

 For joy was there with us; joy that gleams
 And murmurs yet in the world of dreams
   Where thought holds fast, as a constant warder,
 The days when I rode by moors and streams,

 Reining my rhymes into buoyant order
 Through honied leagues of the northland border.
   Though thought or memory fade, and prove
 A faithless keeper, a thriftless hoarder,

 One landmark never can change remove,
 One sign can the years efface not. Love,
   More strong than death or than doubt may be,
 Treads down their strengths, and abides above.

 Yea, change and death are his servants: we,
 Whom love of the dead links fast, though free,
   May smile as they that beheld the dove
 Bear home her signal across the sea.
