                    THE GIRL OF CADIZ.

                    1.

    Oh never talk again to me
      Of northern climes and British ladies;
    It has not been your lot to see,
      Like me, the lovely Girl of Cadiz.
    Although her eye be not of blue,
      Nor fair her locks, like English lasses,
    How far its own expressive hue
      The languid azure eye surpasses!

                    2.

    Prometheus-like from heaven she stole
      The fire that through those silken lashes
    In darkest glances seems to roll,
      From eyes that cannot hide their flashes:
    And as along her bosom steal
      In lengthened flow her raven tresses,
    You'd swear each clustering lock could feel,
      And curled to give her neck caresses.

                    3.

    Our English maids are long to woo,
      And frigid even in possession;
    And if their charms be fair to view,
      Their lips are slow at Love's confession;
    But, born beneath a brighter sun,
      For love ordained the Spanish maid is,
    And who,--when fondly, fairly won,--
      Enchants you like the Girl of Cadiz?

                    4.

    The Spanish maid is no coquette,
      Nor joys to see a lover tremble,
    And if she love, or if she hate,
      Alike she knows not to dissemble.
    Her heart can ne'er be bought or sold--
      Howe'er it beats, it beats sincerely;
    And, though it will not bend to gold,
      'Twill love you long and love you dearly.

                    5.

    The Spanish girl that meets your love
      Ne'er taunts you with a mock denial,
    For every thought is bent to prove
      Her passion in the hour of trial.
    When thronging foemen menace Spain,
      She dares the deed and shares the danger;
    And should her lover press the plain,
      She hurls the spear, her love's avenger.

                    6.

    And when, beneath the evening star,
      She mingles in the gay Bolero,
    Or sings to her attuned guitar
      Of Christian knight or Moorish hero,
    Or counts her beads with fairy hand
      Beneath the twinkling rays of Hesper,
    Or joins Devotion's choral band,
      To chaunt the sweet and hallowed vesper;--

                    7.

    In each her charms the heart must move
      Of all who venture to behold her;
    Then let not maids less fair reprove
      Because her bosom is not colder:
    Through many a clime 'tis mine to roam
      Where many a soft and melting maid is,
    But none abroad, and few at home,
      May match the dark-eyed Girl of Cadiz.

                                                                     1809.
                                                  



        LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM, AT MALTA.

                    1.

    As o'er the cold sepulchral stone
      Some name arrests the passer-by;
    Thus, when thou view'st this page alone,
      May mine attract thy pensive eye!

                    2.

    And when by thee that name is read,
      Perchance in some succeeding year,
    Reflect on me as on the dead,
      And think my Heart is buried here.

                                              Malta, September 14, 1809.
                           



                     TO FLORENCE.

                    1.

    Oh Lady! when I left the shore,
      The distant shore which gave me birth,
    I hardly thought to grieve once more,
      To quit another spot on earth:

                    2.

    Yet here, amidst this barren isle,
      Where panting Nature droops the head,
    Where only thou art seen to smile,
      I view my parting hour with dread.

                    3.

    Though far from Albin's craggy shore,
      Divided by the dark-blue main;
    A few, brief, rolling seasons o'er,
      Perchance I view her cliffs again:

                    4.

    But wheresoe'er I now may roam,
      Through scorching clime, and varied sea,
    Though Time restore me to my home,
      I ne'er shall bend mine eyes on thee:

                    5.

    On thee, in whom at once conspire
      All charms which heedless hearts can move,
    Whom but to see is to admire,
      And, oh! forgive the word--to love.

                    6.

    Forgive the word, in one who ne'er
      With such a word can more offend;
    And since thy heart I cannot share,
      Believe me, what I am, thy friend.

                    7.

    And who so cold as look on thee,
      Thou lovely wand'rer, and be less?
    Nor be, what man should ever be,
      The friend of Beauty in distress?

                    8.

    Ah! who would think that form had past
      Through Danger's most destructive path,
    Had braved the death-winged tempest's blast,
      And 'scaped a Tyrant's fiercer wrath?

                    9.

    Lady! when I shall view the walls
      Where free Byzantium once arose,
    And Stamboul's Oriental halls
      The Turkish tyrants now enclose;

                    10.

    Though mightiest in the lists of fame,
      That glorious city still shall be;
    On me 'twill hold a dearer claim,
      As spot of thy nativity:

                    11.

    And though I bid thee now farewell,
      When I behold that wondrous scene--
    Since where thou art I may not dwell--
      'Twill soothe to be where thou hast been.

                                                       September, 1809.
                           



        STANZAS COMPOSED DURING A THUNDERSTORM.

                    1.

    Chill and mirk is the nightly blast,
      Where Pindus' mountains rise,
    And angry clouds are pouring fast
      The vengeance of the skies.

                    2.

    Our guides are gone, our hope is lost,
      And lightnings, as they play,
    But show where rocks our path have crost,
      Or gild the torrent's spray.

                    3.

    Is yon a cot I saw, though low?
      When lightning broke the gloom--
    How welcome were its shade!--ah, no!
      'Tis but a Turkish tomb.

                    4.

    Through sounds of foaming waterfalls,
      I hear a voice exclaim--
    My way-worn countryman, who calls
      On distant England's name.

                    5.

    A shot is fired--by foe or friend?
      Another--'tis to tell
    The mountain-peasants to descend,
      And lead us where they dwell.

                    6.

    Oh! who in such a night will dare
      To tempt the wilderness?
    And who 'mid thunder-peals can hear
      Our signal of distress?

                    7.

    And who that heard our shouts would rise
      To try the dubious road?
    Nor rather deem from nightly cries
      That outlaws were abroad.

                    8.

    Clouds burst, skies flash, oh, dreadful hour!
      More fiercely pours the storm!
    Yet here one thought has still the power
      To keep my bosom warm.

                    9.

    While wandering through each broken path,
      O'er brake and craggy brow;
    While elements exhaust their wrath,
      Sweet Florence, where art thou?

                    10.

    Not on the sea, not on the sea--
      Thy bark hath long been gone:
    Oh, may the storm that pours on me,
      Bow down my head alone!

                    11.

    Full swiftly blew the swift Siroc,
      When last I pressed thy lip;
    And long ere now, with foaming shock,
      Impelled thy gallant ship.

                    12.

    Now thou art safe; nay, long ere now
      Hast trod the shore of Spain;
    'Twere hard if aught so fair as thou
      Should linger on the main.

                    13.

    And since I now remember thee
      In darkness and in dread,
    As in those hours of revelry
      Which Mirth and Music sped;

                    14.

    Do thou, amid the fair white walls,
      If Cadiz yet be free,
    At times from out her latticed halls
      Look o'er the dark blue sea;

                    15.

    Then think upon Calypso's isles,
      Endeared by days gone by;
    To others give a thousand smiles,
      To me a single sigh.

                    16.

    And when the admiring circle mark
      The paleness of thy face,
    A half-formed tear, a transient spark
      Of melancholy grace,

                    17.

    Again thou'lt smile, and blushing shun
      Some coxcomb's raillery;
    Nor own for once thou thought'st on one,
      Who ever thinks on thee.

                    18.

    Though smile and sigh alike are vain,
      When severed hearts repine,
    My spirit flies o'er Mount and Main,
      And mourns in search of thine.

                                                       October 11, 1809.
                    



    STANZAS WRITTEN IN PASSING THE AMBRACIAN GULF.

                    1.

    Through cloudless skies, in silvery sheen,
      Full beams the moon on Actium's coast:
    And on these waves, for Egypt's queen,
      The ancient world was won and lost.

                    2.

    And now upon the scene I look,
      The azure grave of many a Roman;
    Where stern Ambition once forsook
      His wavering crown to follow Woman.

                    3.

    Florence! whom I will love as well
      (As ever yet was said or sung,
    Since Orpheus sang his spouse from Hell)
      Whilst thou art fair and I am young;

                    4.

    Sweet Florence! those were pleasant times,
      When worlds were staked for Ladies' eyes:
    Had bards as many realms as rhymes,
      Thy charms might raise new Antonies.

                    5.

    Though Fate forbids such things to be,
      Yet, by thine eyes and ringlets curled!
    I cannot lose a world for thee,
      But would not lose thee for a World.

                                                      November 14, 1809.
                    



         THE SPELL IS BROKE, THE CHARM IS FLOWN!

            WRITTEN AT ATHENS, JANUARY 16, 1810.


    The spell is broke, the charm is flown!
      Thus is it with Life's fitful fever:
    We madly smile when we should groan;
      Delirium is our best deceiver.
    Each lucid interval of thought
      Recalls the woes of Nature's charter;
    And He that acts as wise men ought,
      But lives--as Saints have died--a martyr.

                    



     WRITTEN AFTER SWIMMING FROM SESTOS TO ABYDOS.

                    1.

    If, in the month of dark December,
      Leander, who was nightly wont
    (What maid will not the tale remember?)
      To cross thy stream, broad Hellespont!

                    2.

    If, when the wintry tempest roared,
      He sped to Hero, nothing loth,
    And thus of old thy current poured,
      Fair Venus! how I pity both!

                    3.

    For me, degenerate modern wretch,
      Though in the genial month of May,
    My dripping limbs I faintly stretch,
      And think I've done a feat to-day.

                    4.

    But since he crossed the rapid tide,
      According to the doubtful story,
    To woo,--and--Lord knows what beside,
      And swam for Love, as I for Glory;

                    5.

    'Twere hard to say who fared the best:
      Sad mortals! thus the Gods still plague you!
    He lost his labour, I my jest:
      For he was drowned, and I've the ague.

     LINES IN THE TRAVELLERS' BOOK AT ORCHOMENUS.

         IN THIS BOOK A TRAVELLER HAD WRITTEN:--

    "Fair Albion, smiling, sees her son depart
    To trace the birth and nursery of art:
    Noble his object, glorious is his aim;
    He comes to Athens, and he--writes his name."

         BENEATH WHICH LORD BYRON INSERTED THE FOLLOWING:--

    The modest bard, like many a bard unknown,
    Rhymes on our names, but wisely hides his own;
    But yet, whoe'er he be, to say no worse,
    His name would bring more credit than his verse.

                                                                     1810.

                    1.

    Maid of Athens, ere we part,
    Give, oh give me back my heart!
    Or, since that has left my breast,
    Keep it now, and take the rest!
    Hear my vow before I go,

    By those tresses unconfined,

    Kiss thy soft cheeks' blooming tinge;
    By those wild eyes like the roe,

                    3.

    By that lip I long to taste;
    By that zone-encircled waist;

    What words can never speak so well;
    By love's alternate joy and woe,
    ??? ???, ??? ?????.

    Maid of Athens! I am gone:
    Think of me, sweet! when alone.

    Athens holds my heart and soul:
    Can I cease to love thee? No!

          FRAGMENT FROM THE "MONK OF ATHOS."

                    1.

    Beside the confines of the ?gean main,
       Where northward Macedonia bounds the flood,
    And views opposed the Asiatic plain,
       Where once the pride of lofty Ilion stood,
    Like the great Father of the giant brood,
       With lowering port majestic Athos stands,
    Crowned with the verdure of eternal wood,
       As yet unspoiled by sacrilegious hands,
    And throws his mighty shade o'er seas and distant lands.

                    2.

    And deep embosomed in his shady groves
       Full many a convent rears its glittering spire,
    Mid scenes where Heavenly Contemplation loves
       To kindle in her soul her hallowed fire,
    Where air and sea with rocks and woods conspire
       To breathe a sweet religious calm around,
    Weaning the thoughts from every low desire,
       And the wild waves that break with murmuring sound
    Along the rocky shore proclaim it holy ground.

                    3.

    Sequestered shades where Piety has given
       A quiet refuge from each earthly care,
    Whence the rapt spirit may ascend to Heaven!

    Oh, ye condemned the ills of life to bear!
       As with advancing age your woes increase,
    What bliss amidst these solitudes to share
       The happy foretaste of eternal Peace,
    Till Heaven in mercy bids your pain and sorrows cease.

    Dear object of defeated care!
      Though now of Love and thee bereft,
    To reconcile me with despair
      Thine image and my tears are left.

                    2.

    'Tis said with Sorrow Time can cope;
      But this I feel can ne'er be true:
    For by the death-blow of my Hope
      My Memory immortal grew.

         TRANSLATION OF THE FAMOUS GREEK WAR SONG,
                   "????? ?????? ??? ???????."
           

    Sons of the Greeks, arise!
      The glorious hour's gone forth,
    And, worthy of such ties,
      Display who gave us birth.

                    CHORUS.

    Sons of Greeks! let us go
    In arms against the foe,
    Till their hated blood shall flow
      In a river past our feet.

    Then manfully despising
      The Turkish tyrant's yoke,
    Let your country see you rising,
      And all her chains are broke.
    Brave shades of chiefs and sages,
      Behold the coming strife!
    Hell?nes of past ages,
      Oh, start again to life!
    At the sound of my trumpet, breaking
      Your sleep, oh, join with me!
    And the seven-hilled city seeking,
      Fight, conquer, till we're free.

                 Sons of Greeks, etc.

    Sparta, Sparta, why in slumbers
      Lethargic dost thou lie?
    Awake, and join thy numbers
      With Athens, old ally!
    Leonidas recalling,
      That chief of ancient song,
    Who saved ye once from falling,
      The terrible! the strong!
    Who made that bold diversion
      In old Thermopyl?,
    And warring with the Persian
      To keep his country free;
    With his three hundred waging
      The battle, long he stood,
    And like a lion raging,
      Expired in seas of blood.

                 Sons of Greeks, etc.

                           



              TRANSLATION OF THE ROMAIC SONG,

                    "????? ???' ?? ????????,
                    ????????? ?????," ?.?.?.
                

    I enter thy garden of roses,
      Belov?d and fair Haid?e,
    Each morning where Flora reposes,
      For surely I see her in thee.
    Oh, Lovely! thus low I implore thee,
      Receive this fond truth from my tongue,
    Which utters its song to adore thee,
      Yet trembles for what it has sung;
    As the branch, at the bidding of Nature,
      Adds fragrance and fruit to the tree,
    Through her eyes, through her every feature,
      Shines the soul of the young Haid?e.

    But the loveliest garden grows hateful
      When Love has abandoned the bowers;
    Bring me hemlock--since mine is ungrateful,
      That herb is more fragrant than flowers.
    The poison, when poured from the chalice,
      Will deeply embitter the bowl;
    But when drunk to escape from thy malice,
      The draught shall be sweet to my soul.
    Too cruel! in vain I implore thee
      My heart from these horrors to save:
    Will nought to my bosom restore thee?
      Then open the gates of the grave.

    As the chief who to combat advances
      Secure of his conquest before,
    Thus thou, with those eyes for thy lances,
      Hast pierced through my heart to its core.
    Ah, tell me, my soul! must I perish
      By pangs which a smile would dispel?
    Would the hope, which thou once bad'st me cherish,
      For torture repay me too well?
    Now sad is the garden of roses,
      Belov?d but false Haid?e!
    There Flora all withered reposes,
      And mourns o'er thine absence with me.

                                                                     1811.
                           



                        ON PARTING.

                    1.

    The kiss, dear maid! thy lip has left
      Shall never part from mine,
    Till happier hours restore the gift
      Untainted back to thine.

                    2.

    Thy parting glance, which fondly beams,
      An equal love may see:
    The tear that from thine eyelid streams
      Can weep no change in me.

                    3.

    I ask no pledge to make me blest
      In gazing when alone;
    Nor one memorial for a breast,
      Whose thoughts are all thine own.

                    4.

    Nor need I write--to tell the tale
      My pen were doubly weak:
    Oh! what can idle words avail,
      Unless the heart could speak?

                    5.

    By day or night, in weal or woe,
      That heart, no longer free,
    Must bear the love it cannot show,
      And silent ache for thee.

                                                            March, 1811.
                            



                   FAREWELL TO MALTA.

    Adieu, ye joys of La Valette!
    Adieu, Sirocco, sun, and sweat!
    Adieu, thou palace rarely entered!
    Adieu, ye mansions where--I've ventured!
    Adieu, ye curs?d streets of stairs!
    (How surely he who mounts them swears!)
    Adieu, ye merchants often failing!
    Adieu, thou mob for ever railing!
    Adieu, ye packets--without letters!
    Adieu, ye fools--who ape your betters!                               
    Adieu, thou damned'st quarantine,
    That gave me fever, and the spleen!
    Adieu that stage which makes us yawn, Sirs,
    Adieu his Excellency's dancers!
    Adieu to Peter--whom no fault's in,
    But could not teach a colonel waltzing;
    Adieu, ye females fraught with graces!
    Adieu red coats, and redder faces!
    Adieu the supercilious air
    Of all that strut en militaire!                                
    I go--but God knows when, or why,
    To smoky towns and cloudy sky,
    To things (the honest truth to say)
    As bad--but in a different way.

    Farewell to these, but not adieu,
    Triumphant sons of truest blue!
    While either Adriatic shore,
    And fallen chiefs, and fleets no more,
    And nightly smiles, and daily dinners,
    Proclaim you war and women's winners.                                
    Pardon my Muse, who apt to prate is,
    And take my rhyme--because 'tis "gratis."

    And now I've got to Mrs. Fraser,
    Perhaps you think I mean to praise her--
    And were I vain enough to think
    My praise was worth this drop of ink,
    A line--or two--were no hard matter,
    As here, indeed, I need not flatter:
    But she must be content to shine
    In better praises than in mine,                                      
    With lively air, and open heart,
    And fashion's ease, without its art;
    Her hours can gaily glide along.
    Nor ask the aid of idle song.

    And now, O Malta! since thou'st got us,
    Thou little military hot-house!
    I'll not offend with words uncivil,
    And wish thee rudely at the Devil,
    But only stare from out my casement,
    And ask, "for what is such a place meant?"                           
    Then, in my solitary nook,
    Return to scribbling, or a book,
    Or take my physic while I'm able
    (Two spoonfuls hourly, by this label),
    Prefer my nightcap to my beaver,
    And bless my stars I've got a fever.

                                                       May 26, 1811.
                                                  



                      NEWSTEAD ABBEY.

                    1.

    In the dome of my Sires as the clear moonbeam falls
    Through Silence and Shade o'er its desolate walls,
    It shines from afar like the glories of old;
    It gilds, but it warms not--'tis dazzling, but cold.

                    2.

    Let the Sunbeam be bright for the younger of days:
    'Tis the light that should shine on a race that decays,
    When the Stars are on high and the dews on the ground,
    And the long shadow lingers the ruin around.

                    3.

    And the step that o'erechoes the gray floor of stone
    Falls sullenly now, for 'tis only my own;
    And sunk are the voices that sounded in mirth,
    And empty the goblet, and dreary the hearth.

                    4.

    And vain was each effort to raise and recall
    The brightness of old to illumine our Hall;
    And vain was the hope to avert our decline,
    And the fate of my fathers had faded to mine.

                    5.

    And theirs was the wealth and the fulness of Fame,
    And mine to inherit too haughty a name;
    And theirs were the times and the triumphs of yore,
    And mine to regret, but renew them no more.

                    6.

    And Ruin is fixed on my tower and my wall,
    Too hoary to fade, and too massy to fall;
    It tells not of Time's or the tempest's decay,
    But the wreck of the line that have held it in sway.

                                                        August 26, 1811.
           



                  EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,

        IN ANSWER TO SOME LINES EXHORTING THE AUTHOR
           TO BE CHEERFUL, AND TO "BANISH CARE."

    "Oh! banish care"--such ever be
    The motto of thy revelry!
    Perchance of mine, when wassail nights
    Renew those riotous delights,
    Wherewith the children of Despair
    Lull the lone heart, and "banish care."
    But not in Morn's reflecting hour,
    When present, past, and future lower,
    When all I loved is changed or gone,
    Mock with such taunts the woes of one,
    Whose every thought--but let them pass--
    Thou know'st I am not what I was.
    But, above all, if thou wouldst hold
    Place in a heart that ne'er was cold,
    By all the powers that men revere,
    By all unto thy bosom dear,
    Thy joys below, thy hopes above,
    Speak--speak of anything but Love.

      'Twere long to tell, and vain to hear,
    The tale of one who scorns a tear;
    And there is little in that tale
    Which better bosoms would bewail.
    But mine has suffered more than well
    'Twould suit philosophy to tell.
    I've seen my bride another's bride,--
    Have seen her seated by his side,--
    Have seen the infant, which she bore,
    Wear the sweet smile the mother wore,
    When she and I in youth have smiled,
    As fond and faultless as her child;--
    Have seen her eyes, in cold disdain,
    Ask if I felt no secret pain;
    And I have acted well my part,
    And made my cheek belie my heart,
    Returned the freezing glance she gave,
    Yet felt the while that woman's slave;--
    Have kissed, as if without design,
    The babe which ought to have been mine,
    And showed, alas! in each caress
    Time had not made me love the less.

      But let this pass--I'll whine no more,
    Nor seek again an eastern shore;
    The world befits a busy brain,--
    I'll hie me to its haunts again.
    But if, in some succeeding year,
    When Britain's "May is in the sere,"
    Thou hear'st of one, whose deepening crimes
    Suit with the sablest of the times,
    Of one, whom love nor pity sways,
    Nor hope of fame, nor good men's praise;
    One, who in stern Ambition's pride,
    Perchance not blood shall turn aside;
    One ranked in some recording page
    With the worst anarchs of the age,
    Him wilt thou know--and knowing pause,
    Nor with the effect forget the cause.

                                            Newstead Abbey, Oct. 11, 1811.
                                          



                     TO THYRZA.

    Without a stone to mark the spot,
      And say, what Truth might well have said,
    By all, save one, perchance forgot,
      Ah! wherefore art thou lowly laid?
    By many a shore and many a sea
      Divided, yet beloved in vain;
    The Past, the Future fled to thee,
      To bid us meet--no--ne'er again!
    Could this have been--a word, a look,
      That softly said, "We part in peace,"
    Had taught my bosom how to brook,
      With fainter sighs, thy soul's release.
    And didst thou not, since Death for thee
      Prepared a light and pangless dart,
    Once long for him thou ne'er shalt see,
      Who held, and holds thee in his heart?
    Oh! who like him had watched thee here?
      Or sadly marked thy glazing eye,
    In that dread hour ere Death appear,
      When silent Sorrow fears to sigh,
    Till all was past? But when no more
      'Twas thine to reck of human woe,
    Affection's heart-drops, gushing o'er,
      Had flowed as fast--as now they flow.
    Shall they not flow, when many a day
      In these, to me, deserted towers,
    Ere called but for a time away,
      Affection's mingling tears were ours?
    Ours too the glance none saw beside;
      The smile none else might understand;
    The whispered thought of hearts allied,
      The pressure of the thrilling hand;
    The kiss, so guiltless and refined,
      That Love each warmer wish forbore;
    Those eyes proclaimed so pure a mind,
      Ev'n Passion blushed to plead for more.
    The tone, that taught me to rejoice,
      When prone, unlike thee, to repine;
    The song, celestial from thy voice,
      But sweet to me from none but thine;
    The pledge we wore--I wear it still,
      But where is thine?--Ah! where art thou?
    Oft have I borne the weight of ill,
      But never bent beneath till now!
    Well hast thou left in Life's best bloom
      The cup of Woe for me to drain.
    If rest alone be in the tomb,
      I would not wish thee here again:
    But if in worlds more blest than this
      Thy virtues seek a fitter sphere,
    Impart some portion of thy bliss,
      To wean me from mine anguish here.
    Teach me--too early taught by thee!
      To bear, forgiving and forgiven:
    On earth thy love was such to me;
      It fain would form my hope in Heaven!

                                                         October 11, 1811.
                           



            AWAY, AWAY, YE NOTES OF WOE!

                    1.

    Away, away, ye notes of Woe!
      Be silent, thou once soothing Strain,
    Or I must flee from hence--for, oh!
      I dare not trust those sounds again.
    To me they speak of brighter days--
      But lull the chords, for now, alas!
    I must not think, I may not gaze,
      On what I am--on what I was.

                    2.

    The voice that made those sounds more sweet
      Is hushed, and all their charms are fled;
    And now their softest notes repeat
      A dirge, an anthem o'er the dead!
    Yes, Thyrza! yes, they breathe of thee,
      Belov?d dust! since dust thou art;
    And all that once was Harmony
      Is worse than discord to my heart!

                    3.

    'Tis silent all!--but on my ear
      The well remembered Echoes thrill;
    I hear a voice I would not hear,
      A voice that now might well be still:
    Yet oft my doubting Soul 'twill shake;
      Ev'n Slumber owns its gentle tone,
    Till Consciousness will vainly wake
      To listen, though the dream be flown.

                    4.

    Sweet Thyrza! waking as in sleep,
      Thou art but now a lovely dream;
    A Star that trembled o'er the deep,
      Then turned from earth its tender beam.
    But he who through Life's dreary way
      Must pass, when Heaven is veiled in wrath,
    Will long lament the vanished ray
      That scattered gladness o'er his path.

                                                       December 8, 1811.
                           



           ONE STRUGGLE MORE, AND I AM FREE.

                    1.

    One struggle more, and I am free
      From pangs that rend my heart in twain;
    One last long sigh to Love and thee,
      Then back to busy life again.
    It suits me well to mingle now
      With things that never pleased before:
    Though every joy is fled below,
      What future grief can touch me more?

                    2.

    Then bring me wine, the banquet bring;
      Man was not formed to live alone:
    I'll be that light unmeaning thing
      That smiles with all, and weeps with none.
    It was not thus in days more dear,
      It never would have been, but thou
    Hast fled, and left me lonely here;
      Thou'rt nothing,--all are nothing now.

                    3.

    In vain my lyre would lightly breathe!
      The smile that Sorrow fain would wear
    But mocks the woe that lurks beneath,
      Like roses o'er a sepulchre.
    Though gay companions o'er the bowl
      Dispel awhile the sense of ill;
    Though Pleasure fires the maddening soul,
      The Heart,--the Heart is lonely still!

                    4.

    On many a lone and lovely night
      It soothed to gaze upon the sky;
    For then I deemed the heavenly light
      Shone sweetly on thy pensive eye:
    And oft I thought at Cynthia's noon,
      When sailing o'er the ?gean wave,
    "Now Thyrza gazes on that moon"--
      Alas, it gleamed upon her grave!

                    5.

    When stretched on Fever's sleepless bed,
      And sickness shrunk my throbbing veins,
    "'Tis comfort still," I faintly said,
      "That Thyrza cannot know my pains:"
    Like freedom to the time-worn slave--
      A boon 'tis idle then to give--
    Relenting Nature vainly gave
      My life, when Thyrza ceased to live!

                    6.

    My Thyrza's pledge in better days,
      When Love and Life alike were new!
    How different now thou meet'st my gaze!
      How tinged by time with Sorrow's hue!
    The heart that gave itself with thee
      Is silent--ah, were mine as still!
    Though cold as e'en the dead can be,
      It feels, it sickens with the chill.

                    7.

    Thou bitter pledge! thou mournful token!
      Though painful, welcome to my breast!
    Still, still, preserve that love unbroken,
      Or break the heart to which thou'rt pressed.
    Time tempers Love, but not removes,
      More hallowed when its Hope is fled:
    Oh! what are thousand living loves
      To that which cannot quit the dead?

                           



                        EUTHANASIA.

                    1.

    When Time, or soon or late, shall bring
      The dreamless sleep that lulls the dead,
    Oblivion! may thy languid wing
      Wave gently o'er my dying bed!

                    2.

    No band of friends or heirs be there,
      To weep, or wish, the coming blow:
    No maiden, with dishevelled hair,
      To feel, or feign, decorous woe.

                    3.

    But silent let me sink to Earth,
      With no officious mourners near:
    I would not mar one hour of mirth,
      Nor startle Friendship with a fear.

                    4.

    Yet Love, if Love in such an hour
      Could nobly check its useless sighs,
    Might then exert its latest power
      In her who lives, and him who dies.

                    5.

    'Twere sweet, my Psyche! to the last
      Thy features still serene to see:
    Forgetful of its struggles past,
      E'en Pain itself should smile on thee.

                    6.

    But vain the wish--for Beauty still
      Will shrink, as shrinks the ebbing breath;
    And Woman's tears, produced at will,
      Deceive in life, unman in death.

                    7.

    Then lonely be my latest hour,
      Without regret, without a groan;
    For thousands Death hath ceased to lower,
      And pain been transient or unknown.

                    8.

    "Aye but to die, and go," alas!
      Where all have gone, and all must go!
    To be the nothing that I was
      Ere born to life and living woe!

                    9.

    Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
      Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
    And know, whatever thou hast been,
      'Tis something better not to be.

                



         AND THOU ART DEAD, AS YOUNG AND FAIR.

"Heu, quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse!"

                    1.

    And thou art dead, as young and fair
      As aught of mortal birth;
    And form so soft, and charms so rare,
      Too soon returned to Earth!
    Though Earth received them in her bed,
    And o'er the spot the crowd may tread
      In carelessness or mirth,
    There is an eye which could not brook
    A moment on that grave to look.

                    2.

    I will not ask where thou liest low,
      Nor gaze upon the spot;
    There flowers or weeds at will may grow,
      So I behold them not:
    It is enough for me to prove
    That what I loved, and long must love,
      Like common earth can rot;
    To me there needs no stone to tell,
    'Tis Nothing that I loved so well

                    3.

    Yet did I love thee to the last
      As fervently as thou,
    Who didst not change through all the past,
      And canst not alter now.
    The love where Death has set his seal,
    Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,
      Nor falsehood disavow:
    And, what were worse, thou canst not see
    Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.

                    4.

    The better days of life were ours;
      The worst can be but mine:
    The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,
      Shall never more be thine.
    The silence of that dreamless sleep
    I envy now too much to weep;
      Nor need I to repine,
    That all those charms have passed away
    I might have watched through long decay.

                    5.

    The flower in ripened bloom unmatched
      Must fall the earliest prey;
    Though by no hand untimely snatched,
      The leaves must drop away:
    And yet it were a greater grief
    To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,
      Than see it plucked to-day;
    Since earthly eye but ill can bear
    To trace the change to foul from fair.

                    6.

    I know not if I could have borne
      To see thy beauties fade;
    The night that followed such a morn
      Had worn a deeper shade:
    Thy day without a cloud hath passed,
    And thou wert lovely to the last;
      Extinguished, not decayed;
    As stars that shoot along the sky
    Shine brightest as they fall from high.

                    7.

    As once I wept, if I could weep,
      My tears might well be shed,
    To think I was not near to keep
      One vigil o'er thy bed;
    To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,
    To fold thee in a faint embrace,
      Uphold thy drooping head;
    And show that love, however vain,
    Nor thou nor I can feel again.

                    8.

    Yet how much less it were to gain,
      Though thou hast left me free,
    The loveliest things that still remain,
      Than thus remember thee!
    The all of thine that cannot die
    Through dark and dread Eternity
      Returns again to me,
    And more thy buried love endears
    Than aught, except its living years.

                                                         February, 1812.
               



              LINES TO A LADY WEEPING.

    Weep, daughter of a royal line,
      A Sire's disgrace, a realm's decay;
    Ah! happy if each tear of thine
      Could wash a Father's fault away!
    Weep--for thy tears are Virtue's tears--
      Auspicious to these suffering Isles;
    And be each drop in future years
      Repaid thee by thy People's smiles!

                                                            March, 1812.
               



           IF SOMETIMES IN THE HAUNTS OF MEN.

                    1.

    If sometimes in the haunts of men
      Thine image from my breast may fade,
    The lonely hour presents again
      The semblance of thy gentle shade:
    And now that sad and silent hour
      Thus much of thee can still restore,
    And sorrow unobserved may pour
      The plaint she dare not speak before.

                    2.

    Oh, pardon that in crowds awhile
      I waste one thought I owe to thee,
    And self-condemned, appear to smile,
      Unfaithful to thy memory:
    Nor deem that memory less dear,
      That then I seem not to repine;
    I would not fools should overhear
      One sigh that should be wholly thine.

                    3.

    If not the Goblet pass unquaffed,
      It is not drained to banish care;
    The cup must hold a deadlier draught
      That brings a Lethe for despair.
    And could Oblivion set my soul
      From all her troubled visions free,
    I'd dash to earth the sweetest bowl
      That drowned a single thought of thee.

                    4.

    For wert thou vanished from my mind,
      Where could my vacant bosom turn?
    And who would then remain behind
      To honour thine abandoned Urn?
    No, no--it is my sorrow's pride
      That last dear duty to fulfil;
    Though all the world forget beside,
      'Tis meet that I remember still.

                    5.

    For well I know, that such had been
      Thy gentle care for him, who now
    Unmourned shall quit this mortal scene,
      Where none regarded him, but thou:
    And, oh! I feel in that was given
      A blessing never meant for me;
    Thou wert too like a dream of Heaven,
      For earthly Love to merit thee.

                                                           March 14, 1812.
                



         ON A CORNELIAN HEART WHICH WAS BROKEN.

                    1.

    Ill-fated Heart! and can it be,
      That thou shouldst thus be rent in twain?
    Have years of care for thine and thee
      Alike been all employed in vain?

                    2.

    Yet precious seems each shattered part,
      And every fragment dearer grown,
    Since he who wears thee feels thou art
      A fitter emblem of his own.

                                                           March 16, 1812.
                



                     THE CHAIN I GAVE.
                     FROM THE TURKISH.

                    1.

    The chain I gave was fair to view,
      The lute I added sweet in sound;
    The heart that offered both was true,
      And ill deserved the fate it found.

                    2.

    These gifts were charmed by secret spell,
      Thy truth in absence to divine;
    And they have done their duty well,--
      Alas! they could not teach thee thine.

                    3.

    That chain was firm in every link,
      But not to bear a stranger's touch;
    That lute was sweet--till thou couldst think
      In other hands its notes were such.

                    4.

    Let him who from thy neck unbound
      The chain which shivered in his grasp,
    Who saw that lute refuse to sound,
      Restring the chords, renew the clasp.

                    5.

    When thou wert changed, they altered too;
      The chain is broke, the music mute,
    'Tis past--to them and thee adieu--
      False heart, frail chain, and silent lute.

               



              LINES WRITTEN ON A BLANK LEAF OF
               THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY.

                    1.

    Absent or present, still to thee,
      My friend, what magic spells belong!
    As all can tell, who share, like me,
      In turn thy converse, and thy song.

                    2.

    But when the dreaded hour shall come
      By Friendship ever deemed too nigh,
    And "Memory" o'er her Druid's tomb
      Shall weep that aught of thee can die,

                    3.

    How fondly will she then repay
      Thy homage offered at her shrine,
    And blend, while ages roll away,
      Her name immortally with thine!

                                                           April 19, 1812.
                                         



             ADDRESS, SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF
                    DRURY-LANE THEATRE,
              SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1812.

    In one dread night our city saw, and sighed,
    Bowed to the dust, the Drama's tower of pride;
    In one short hour beheld the blazing fane,
    Apollo sink, and Shakespeare cease to reign.

      Ye who beheld, (oh! sight admired and mourned,
    Whose radiance mocked the ruin it adorned!)
    Through clouds of fire the massy fragments riven,
    Like Israel's pillar, chase the night from heaven;
    Saw the long column of revolving flames
    Shake its red shadow o'er the startled Thames,                   
    While thousands, thronged around the burning dome,
    Shrank back appalled, and trembled for their home,
    As glared the volumed blaze, and ghastly shone
    The skies, with lightnings awful as their own,
    Till blackening ashes and the lonely wall
    Usurped the Muse's realm, and marked her fall;
    Say--shall this new, nor less aspiring pile,
    Reared where once rose the mightiest in our isle,
    Know the same favour which the former knew,
    A shrine for Shakespeare--worthy him and you?                      

      Yes--it shall be--the magic of that name
    Defies the scythe of time, the torch of flame;
    On the same spot still consecrates the scene,
    And bids the Drama be where she hath been:
    This fabric's birth attests the potent spell----
    Indulge our honest pride, and say, How well!

      As soars this fane to emulate the last,
    Oh! might we draw our omens from the past,
    Some hour propitious to our prayers may boast
    Names such as hallow still the dome we lost.                         
    On Drury first your Siddons' thrilling art
    O'erwhelmed the gentlest, stormed the sternest heart.
    On Drury, Garrick's latest laurels grew;
    Here your last tears retiring Roscius drew,
    Sighed his last thanks, and wept his last adieu:
    But still for living wit the wreaths may bloom,
    That only waste their odours o'er the tomb.
    Such Drury claimed and claims--nor you refuse
    One tribute to revive his slumbering muse;
    With garlands deck your own Menander's head,                         
    Nor hoard your honours idly for the dead!
    Dear are the days which made our annals bright,
    Ere Garrick fled, or Brinsley ceased to write
    Heirs to their labours, like all high-born heirs,
    Vain of our ancestry as they of theirs;
    While thus Remembrance borrows Banquo's glass
    To claim the sceptred shadows as they pass,
    And we the mirror hold, where imaged shine
    Immortal names, emblazoned on our line,
    Pause--ere their feebler offspring you condemn,                      
    Reflect how hard the task to rival them!

      Friends of the stage! to whom both Players and Plays
    Must sue alike for pardon or for praise,
    Whose judging voice and eye alone direct
    The boundless power to cherish or reject;
    If e'er frivolity has led to fame,
    And made us blush that you forbore to blame--
    If e'er the sinking stage could condescend
    To soothe the sickly taste it dare not mend--
    All past reproach may present scenes refute,                         
    And censure, wisely loud, be justly mute!
    Oh! since your fiat stamps the Drama's laws,
    Forbear to mock us with misplaced applause;
    So Pride shall doubly nerve the actor's powers,
    And Reason's voice be echoed back by ours!

      This greeting o'er--the ancient rule obeyed,
    The Drama's homage by her herald paid--
    Receive our welcome too--whose every tone
    Springs from our hearts, and fain would win your own.
    The curtain rises--may our stage unfold                              
    Scenes not unworthy Drury's days of old!
    Britons our judges, Nature for our guide,
    Still may we please--long, long may you preside.

                    



                 PARENTHETICAL ADDRESS.

                      BY DR. PLAGIARY.

  Half stolen, with acknowledgments, to be spoken in an
      inarticulate voice by Master ---- at the opening of the next
      new theatre. 

    "When energising objects men pursue,"
    Then Lord knows what is writ by Lord knows who.
    A modest Monologue you here survey,
    Hissed from the theatre the "other day,"
    As if Sir Fretful wrote "the slumberous" verse,
    And gave his son "the rubbish" to rehearse.
    "Yet at the thing you'd never be amazed,"
    Knew you the rumpus which the Author raised;
    "Nor even here your smiles would be represt,"
    Knew you these lines--the badness of the best,                       
    "Flame! fire! and flame!" (words borrowed from Lucretius.)
    "Dread metaphors" which open wounds like issues!
    "And sleeping pangs awake--and----But away"--
    (Confound me if I know what next to say).
    Lo "Hope reviving re-expands her wings,"
    And Master G---- recites what Dr. Busby sings!--
    "If mighty things with small we may compare,"
    (Translated from the Grammar for the fair!)
    Dramatic "spirit drives a conquering car,"
    And burn'd poor Moscow like a tub of "tar."                          
    "This spirit" "Wellington has shown in Spain,"
    To furnish Melodrames for Drury Lane.
    "Another Marlborough points to Blenheim's story,"
    And George and I will dramatise it for ye.

      "In Arts and Sciences our Isle hath shone"
    (This deep discovery is mine alone).
    Oh "British poesy, whose powers inspire"
    My verse--or I'm a fool--and Fame's a liar,
    "Thee we invoke, your Sister Arts implore"
    With "smiles," and "lyres," and "pencils," and much more.            
    These, if we win the Graces, too, we gain
    Disgraces, too! "inseparable train!"
    "Three who have stolen their witching airs from Cupid"
    (You all know what I mean, unless you're stupid):
    "Harmonious throng" that I have kept in petto
    Now to produce in a "divine sestetto"!!
    "While Poesy," with these delightful doxies,
    "Sustains her part" in all the "upper" boxes!
    "Thus lifted gloriously, you'll sweep along,"
    Borne in the vast balloon of Busby's song;                           
    "Shine in your farce, masque, scenery, and play"
    (For this last line George had a holiday).
    "Old Drury never, never soar'd so high,"
    So says the Manager, and so say I.
    "But hold," you say, "this self-complacent boast;"
    Is this the Poem which the public lost?
    "True--true--that lowers at once our mounting pride;"
    But lo;--the Papers print what you deride.
    "'Tis ours to look on you--you hold the prize,"
    'Tis twenty guineas, as they advertise!                            
    "A double blessing your rewards impart"--
    I wish I had them, then, with all my heart.
    "Our twofold feeling owns its twofold cause,"
    Why son and I both beg for your applause.
    "When in your fostering beams you bid us live,"
    My next subscription list shall say how much you give!

                 



     VERSES FOUND IN A SUMMER-HOUSE AT HALES-OWEN.

    When Dryden's fool, "unknowing what he sought,"
    His hours in whistling spent, "for want of thought,"
    This guiltless oaf his vacancy of sense
    Supplied, and amply too, by innocence:
    Did modern swains, possessed of Cymon's powers,
    In Cymon's manner waste their leisure hours,
    Th' offended guests would not, with blushing, see
    These fair green walks disgraced by infamy.
    Severe the fate of modern fools, alas!
    When vice and folly mark them as they pass.
    Like noxious reptiles o'er the whitened wall,
    The filth they leave still points out where they crawl.

                                       



             REMEMBER THEE! REMEMBER THEE!

                    1.

    Remember thee! remember thee!
      Till Lethe quench life's burning stream
    Remorse and Shame shall cling to thee,
      And haunt thee like a feverish dream!

                    2.

    Remember thee! Aye, doubt it not.
      Thy husband too shall think of thee:
    By neither shalt thou be forgot,
      Thou false to him, thou fiend to me!

                   



                          TO TIME.

    Time! on whose arbitrary wing
      The varying hours must flag or fly,
    Whose tardy winter, fleeting spring,
      But drag or drive us on to die--
    Hail thou! who on my birth bestowed
      Those boons to all that know thee known;
    Yet better I sustain thy load,
      For now I bear the weight alone.
    I would not one fond heart should share
      The bitter moments thou hast given;
    And pardon thee--since thou couldst spare
      All that I loved, to peace or Heaven.
    To them be joy or rest--on me
      Thy future ills shall press in vain;
    I nothing owe but years to thee,
      A debt already paid in pain.
    Yet even that pain was some relief;
      It felt, but still forgot thy power:
    The active agony of grief
      Retards, but never counts the hour.
    In joy I've sighed to think thy flight
      Would soon subside from swift to slow;
    Thy cloud could overcast the light,
      But could not add a night to Woe;
    For then, however drear and dark,
      My soul was suited to thy sky;
    One star alone shot forth a spark
      To prove thee--not Eternity.
    That beam hath sunk--and now thou art
      A blank--a thing to count and curse
    Through each dull tedious trifling part,
      Which all regret, yet all rehearse.
    One scene even thou canst not deform--
      The limit of thy sloth or speed
    When future wanderers bear the storm
      Which we shall sleep too sound to heed.
    And I can smile to think how weak
      Thine efforts shortly shall be shown,
    When all the vengeance thou canst wreak
      Must fall upon--a nameless stone.

        



             TRANSLATION OF A ROMAIC LOVE SONG.

                    1.

    Ah! Love was never yet without
    The pang, the agony, the doubt,
    Which rends my heart with ceaseless sigh,
    While day and night roll darkling by.

                    2.

    Without one friend to hear my woe,
    I faint, I die beneath the blow.
    That Love had arrows, well I knew,
    Alas! I find them poisoned too.

                    3.

    Birds, yet in freedom, shun the net
    Which Love around your haunts hath set;
    Or, circled by his fatal fire,
    Your hearts shall burn, your hopes expire.

                    4.

    A bird of free and careless wing
    Was I, through many a smiling spring;
    But caught within the subtle snare,
    I burn, and feebly flutter there.

                    5.

    Who ne'er have loved, and loved in vain,
    Can neither feel nor pity pain,
    The cold repulse, the look askance,
    The lightning of Love's angry glance.

                    6.

    In flattering dreams I deemed thee mine;
    Now hope, and he who hoped, decline;
    Like melting wax, or withering flower,
    I feel my passion, and thy power.

                    7.

    My light of Life! ah, tell me why
    That pouting lip, and altered eye?
    My bird of Love! my beauteous mate!
    And art thou changed, and canst thou hate?

                    8.

    Mine eyes like wintry streams o'erflow:
    What wretch with me would barter woe?
    My bird! relent: one note could give
    A charm to bid thy lover live.

                    9.

    My curdling blood, my madd'ning brain,
    In silent anguish I sustain;
    And still thy heart, without partaking
    One pang, exults--while mine is breaking.

                    10.

    Pour me the poison; fear not thou!
    Thou canst not murder more than now:
    I've lived to curse my natal day,
    And Love, that thus can lingering slay.

                    11.

    My wounded soul, my bleeding breast,
    Can patience preach thee into rest?
    Alas! too late, I dearly know
    That Joy is harbinger of Woe.

               



      THOU ART NOT FALSE, BUT THOU ART FICKLE.

                    1.

    Thou art not false, but thou art fickle,
      To those thyself so fondly sought;
    The tears that thou hast forced to trickle
      Are doubly bitter from that thought:
    'Tis this which breaks the heart thou grievest,
    Too well thou lov'st--too soon thou leavest.

                    2.

    The wholly false the heart despises,
      And spurns deceiver and deceit;
    But she who not a thought disguises,
      Whose love is as sincere as sweet,--
    When she can change who loved so truly,
    It feels what mine has felt so newly.

                    3.

    To dream of joy and wake to sorrow
      Is doomed to all who love or live;
    And if, when conscious on the morrow,
      We scarce our Fancy can forgive,
    That cheated us in slumber only,
    To leave the waking soul more lonely,

                    4.

    What must they feel whom no false vision
      But truest, tenderest Passion warmed?
    Sincere, but swift in sad transition:
      As if a dream alone had charmed?
    Ah! sure such grief is Fancy's scheming,
    And all thy Change can be but dreaming!

        



           ON BEING ASKED WHAT WAS THE "ORIGIN OF LOVE."

    The "Origin of Love!"--Ah, why
      That cruel question ask of me,
    When thou mayst read in many an eye
      He starts to life on seeing thee?
    And shouldst thou seek his end to know:
      My heart forebodes, my fears foresee,
    He'll linger long in silent woe;
      But live until--I cease to be.

               



                     ON THE QUOTATION,

    "And my true faith can alter never,
    Though thou art gone perhaps for ever."

                    1.

    And "thy true faith can alter never?"--
      Indeed it lasted for a--week!
    I know the length of Love's forever,
      And just expected such a freak.
    In peace we met, in peace we parted,
      In peace we vowed to meet again,
    And though I find thee fickle-hearted
      No pang of mine shall make thee vain.

                    2.

    One gone--'twas time to seek a second;
      In sooth 'twere hard to blame thy haste.
    And whatsoe'er thy love be reckoned,
      At least thou hast improved in taste:
    Though one was young, the next was younger,
      His love was new, mine too well known--
    And what might make the charm still stronger,
      The youth was present, I was flown.

                    3.

    Seven days and nights of single sorrow!
      Too much for human constancy!
    A fortnight past, why then to-morrow,
      His turn is come to follow me:
    And if each week you change a lover,
      And so have acted heretofore,
    Before a year or two is over
      We'll form a very pretty corps.

                    4.

    Adieu, fair thing! without upbraiding
      I fain would take a decent leave;
    Thy beauty still survives unfading,
      And undeceived may long deceive.
    With him unto thy bosom dearer
      Enjoy the moments as they flee;
    I only wish his love sincerer
      Than thy young heart has been to me.

                                                                     1812.
                              



          REMEMBER HIM, WHOM PASSION'S POWER.

                    1.

    Remember him, whom Passion's power
      Severely--deeply--vainly proved:
    Remember thou that dangerous hour,
      When neither fell, though both were loved.

                    2.

    That yielding breast, that melting eye,
      Too much invited to be blessed:
    That gentle prayer, that pleading sigh,
      The wilder wish reproved, repressed.

                    3.

    Oh! let me feel that all I lost
      But saved thee all that Conscience fears;
    And blush for every pang it cost
      To spare the vain remorse of years.

                    4.

    Yet think of this when many a tongue,
      Whose busy accents whisper blame,
    Would do the heart that loved thee wrong,
      And brand a nearly blighted name.

                    5.

    Think that, whate'er to others, thou
      Hast seen each selfish thought subdued:
    I bless thy purer soul even now,
      Even now, in midnight solitude.

                    6.

    Oh, God! that we had met in time,
      Our hearts as fond, thy hand more free;
    When thou hadst loved without a crime,
      And I been less unworthy thee!

                    7.

    Far may thy days, as heretofore,
      From this our gaudy world be past!
    And that too bitter moment o'er,
      Oh! may such trial be thy last.

                    8.

    This heart, alas! perverted long,
      Itself destroyed might there destroy;
    To meet thee in the glittering throng,
      Would wake Presumption's hope of joy.

                    9.

    Then to the things whose bliss or woe,
      Like mine, is wild and worthless all,
    That world resign--such scenes forego,
      Where those who feel must surely fall.

                    10.

    Thy youth, thy charms, thy tenderness--
      Thy soul from long seclusion pure;
    From what even here hath passed, may guess
        What there thy bosom must endure.

                    11.

    Oh! pardon that imploring tear,
      Since not by Virtue shed in vain,
    My frenzy drew from eyes so dear;
      For me they shall not weep again.

                    12.

    Though long and mournful must it be,
      The thought that we no more may meet;
    Yet I deserve the stern decree,
      And almost deem the sentence sweet.

                    13.

    Still--had I loved thee less--my heart
      Had then less sacrificed to thine;
    It felt not half so much to part
      As if its guilt had made thee mine.

                                                                     1813.
        



            IMPROMPTU, IN REPLY TO A FRIEND.

    When, from the heart where Sorrow sits,
      Her dusky shadow mounts too high,
    And o'er the changing aspect flits,
      And clouds the brow, or fills the eye;
    Heed not that gloom, which soon shall sink:
      My Thoughts their dungeon know too well;
    Back to my breast the Wanderers shrink,
      And droop within their silent cell.

                                                        September, 1813.
        



                          SONNET.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thine eyes' blue tenderness, thy long fair hair,
      And the warm lustre of thy features--caught
      From contemplation--where serenely wrought,
    Seems Sorrow's softness charmed from its despair--
    Have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air,
      That--but I know thy blessed bosom fraught
      With mines of unalloyed and stainless thought--
    I should have deemed thee doomed to earthly care.
    With such an aspect, by his colours blent,
      When from his beauty-breathing pencil born,
    (Except that thou hast nothing to repent)
      The Magdalen of Guido saw the morn--
    Such seem'st thou--but how much more excellent!
      With nought Remorse can claim--nor Virtue scorn.

                                                  December 17, 1813.
              



                          SONNET.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thy cheek is pale with thought, but not from woe,
      And yet so lovely, that if Mirth could flush
      Its rose of whiteness with the brightest blush,
    My heart would wish away that ruder glow:
    And dazzle not thy deep-blue eyes--but, oh!
      While gazing on them sterner eyes will gush,
      And into mine my mother's weakness rush,
    Soft as the last drops round Heaven's airy bow.
    For, through thy long dark lashes low depending,
      The soul of melancholy Gentleness
    Gleams like a Seraph from the sky descending,
      Above all pain, yet pitying all distress;
    At once such majesty with sweetness blending,
      I worship more, but cannot love thee less.

                                                      December 17, 1813.
               



                    FROM THE PORTUGUESE.

                       "TU MI CHAMAS"

                    1.

    In moments to delight devoted,
      "My Life!" with tenderest tone, you cry;
    Dear words! on which my heart had doted,
      If Youth could neither fade nor die.

                    2.

    To Death even hours like these must roll,
      Ah! then repeat those accents never;
    Or change "my Life!" into "my Soul!"
      Which, like my Love, exists for ever.

                                                                  

                      ANOTHER VERSION.

    You call me still your Life.--Oh! change the word--
      Life is as transient as the inconstant sigh:
    Say rather I'm your Soul; more just that name,
      For, like the soul, my Love can never die.

                      





                               THE GIAOUR.


      No breath of air to break the wave
    That rolls below the Athenian's grave,
    That tomb which, gleaming o'er the cliff,
    First greets the homeward-veering skiff
    High o'er the land he saved in vain;
    When shall such Hero live again?

                                       

      Fair clime! where every season smiles
    Benignant o'er those blessed isles,
    Which, seen from far Colonna's height,
    Make glad the heart that hails the sight,                            
    And lend to loneliness delight.
    There mildly dimpling, Ocean's cheek
    Reflects the tints of many a peak
    Caught by the laughing tides that lave
    These Edens of the eastern wave:
    And if at times a transient breeze
    Break the blue crystal of the seas,
    Or sweep one blossom from the trees,
    How welcome is each gentle air
    That wakes and wafts the odours there!                               
    For there the Rose, o'er crag or vale,
    Sultana of the Nightingale,
      The maid for whom his melody,
      His thousand songs are heard on high,
    Blooms blushing to her lover's tale:
    His queen, the garden queen, his Rose,
    Unbent by winds, unchilled by snows,
    Far from the winters of the west,
    By every breeze and season blest,
    Returns the sweets by Nature given                                   
    In softest incense back to Heaven;
    And grateful yields that smiling sky
    Her fairest hue and fragrant sigh.
    And many a summer flower is there,
    And many a shade that Love might share,
    And many a grotto, meant for rest,
    That holds the pirate for a guest;
    Whose bark in sheltering cove below
    Lurks for the passing peaceful prow,
    Till the gay mariner's guitar                                    
    Is heard, and seen the Evening Star;
    Then stealing with the muffled oar,
    Far shaded by the rocky shore,
    Rush the night-prowlers on the prey,
    And turn to groans his roundelay.
    Strange--that where Nature loved to trace,
    As if for Gods, a dwelling place,
    And every charm and grace hath mixed
    Within the Paradise she fixed,
    There man, enamoured of distress,                                    
    Should mar it into wilderness,
    And trample, brute-like, o'er each flower
    That tasks not one laborious hour;
    Nor claims the culture of his hand
    To bloom along the fairy land,
    But springs as to preclude his care,
    And sweetly woos him--but to spare!
    Strange--that where all is Peace beside,
    There Passion riots in her pride,
    And Lust and Rapine wildly reign                                     
    To darken o'er the fair domain.
    It is as though the Fiends prevailed
    Against the Seraphs they assailed,
    And, fixed on heavenly thrones, should dwell
    The freed inheritors of Hell;
    So soft the scene, so formed for joy,
    So curst the tyrants that destroy!

      He who hath bent him o'er the dead
    Ere the first day of Death is fled,
    The first dark day of Nothingness,                                   
    The last of Danger and Distress,
    (Before Decay's effacing fingers
    Have swept the lines where Beauty lingers,)
    And marked the mild angelic air,
    The rapture of Repose that's there,
    The fixed yet tender traits that streak
    The languor of the placid cheek,
    And--but for that sad shrouded eye,
      That fires not, wins not, weeps not, now,
      And but for that chill, changeless brow,                           
      Where cold Obstruction's apathy
      Appals the gazing mourner's heart,
      As if to him it could impart
      The doom he dreads, yet dwells upon;
      Yes, but for these and these alone,
      Some moments, aye, one treacherous hour,
      He still might doubt the Tyrant's power;
      So fair, so calm, so softly sealed,
      The first, last look by Death revealed!
      Such is the aspect of this shore;                                  
      'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!
      So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,
      We start, for Soul is wanting there.
      Hers is the loveliness in death,
      That parts not quite with parting breath;
      But beauty with that fearful bloom,
      That hue which haunts it to the tomb,
      Expression's last receding ray,
      A gilded Halo hovering round decay,
      The farewell beam of Feeling past away!                           
    Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,
    Which gleams, but warms no more its cherished earth!

        Clime of the unforgotten brave!
      Whose land from plain to mountain-cave
      Was Freedom's home or Glory's grave!
      Shrine of the mighty! can it be,
      That this is all remains of thee?
      Approach, thou craven crouching slave:
        Say, is not this Thermopyl??
      These waters blue that round you lave,--                          
        Oh servile offspring of the free--
      Pronounce what sea, what shore is this?
      The gulf, the rock of Salamis!
      These scenes, their story not unknown,
      Arise, and make again your own;
      Snatch from the ashes of your Sires
      The embers of their former fires;
      And he who in the strife expires
      Will add to theirs a name of fear
      That Tyranny shall quake to hear,                                 
      And leave his sons a hope, a fame,
      They too will rather die than shame:
      For Freedom's battle once begun,
      Bequeathed by bleeding Sire to Son,
      Though baffled oft is ever won.
      Bear witness, Greece, thy living page!
      Attest it many a deathless age!
      While Kings, in dusty darkness hid,
      Have left a nameless pyramid,
      Thy Heroes, though the general doom                               
      Hath swept the column from their tomb,
      A mightier monument command,
      The mountains of their native land!
      There points thy Muse to stranger's eye
      The graves of those that cannot die!
      'Twere long to tell, and sad to trace,
      Each step from Splendour to Disgrace;
      Enough--no foreign foe could quell
      Thy soul, till from itself it fell;
      Yet! Self-abasement paved the way                                 
      To villain-bonds and despot sway.

      What can he tell who treads thy shore?
        No legend of thine olden time,
      No theme on which the Muse might soar
      High as thine own in days of yore,
        When man was worthy of thy clime.
      The hearts within thy valleys bred,
      The fiery souls that might have led
        Thy sons to deeds sublime,
      Now crawl from cradle to the Grave,                               
      Slaves--nay, the bondsmen of a Slave,
        And callous, save to crime;
      Stained with each evil that pollutes
      Mankind, where least above the brutes;
      Without even savage virtue blest,
      Without one free or valiant breast,
      Still to the neighbouring ports they waft
      Proverbial wiles, and ancient craft;
      In this the subtle Greek is found,
      For this, and this alone, renowned.                               
      In vain might Liberty invoke
      The spirit to its bondage broke
      Or raise the neck that courts the yoke:
      No more her sorrows I bewail,
      Yet this will be a mournful tale,
      And they who listen may believe,
      Who heard it first had cause to grieve.

                                       

        Far, dark, along the blue sea glancing,
      The shadows of the rocks advancing
      Start on the fisher's eye like boat                               
      Of island-pirate or Mainote;
      And fearful for his light ca?que,
      He shuns the near but doubtful creek:
      Though worn and weary with his toil,
      And cumbered with his scaly spoil,
      Slowly, yet strongly, plies the oar,
      Till Port Leone's safer shore
      Receives him by the lovely light
      That best becomes an Eastern night.

                                       

        Who thundering comes on blackest steed,                     
      With slackened bit and hoof of speed?
      Beneath the clattering iron's sound
      The caverned Echoes wake around
      In lash for lash, and bound for bound:
      The foam that streaks the courser's side
      Seems gathered from the Ocean-tide:
      Though weary waves are sunk to rest,
      There's none within his rider's breast;
      And though to-morrow's tempest lower,
      'Tis calmer than thy heart, young Giaour!                     
      I know thee not, I loathe thy race,
      But in thy lineaments I trace
      What Time shall strengthen, not efface:
      Though young and pale, that sallow front
      Is scathed by fiery Passion's brunt;
      Though bent on earth thine evil eye,
      As meteor-like thou glidest by,
      Right well I view and deem thee one
      Whom Othman's sons should slay or shun.

        On--on he hastened, and he drew                                 
      My gaze of wonder as he flew:
      Though like a Demon of the night
      He passed, and vanished from my sight,
      His aspect and his air impressed
      A troubled memory on my breast,
      And long upon my startled ear
      Rung his dark courser's hoofs of fear.
      He spurs his steed; he nears the steep,
      That, jutting, shadows o'er the deep;
      He winds around; he hurries by;                                   
      The rock relieves him from mine eye;
      For, well I ween, unwelcome he
      Whose glance is fixed on those that flee;
      And not a star but shines too bright
      On him who takes such timeless flight.
      He wound along; but ere he passed
      One glance he snatched, as if his last,
      A moment checked his wheeling steed,
      A moment breathed him from his speed,
      A moment on his stirrup stood--                                   
      Why looks he o'er the olive wood?
      The Crescent glimmers on the hill,
      The Mosque's high lamps are quivering still
      Though too remote for sound to wake
      In echoes of the far tophaike,
      The flashes of each joyous peal
      Are seen to prove the Moslem's zeal.
      To-night, set Rhamazani's sun;
      To-night, the Bairam feast's begun;
      To-night--but who and what art thou                               
      Of foreign garb and fearful brow?
      And what are these to thine or thee,
      That thou shouldst either pause or flee?

        He stood--some dread was on his face,
      Soon Hatred settled in its place:
      It rose not with the reddening flush
      Of transient Anger's hasty blush,
      But pale as marble o'er the tomb,
      Whose ghastly whiteness aids its gloom.
      His brow was bent, his eye was glazed;                            
      He raised his arm, and fiercely raised,
      And sternly shook his hand on high,
      As doubting to return or fly;
      Impatient of his flight delayed,
      Here loud his raven charger neighed--
      Down glanced that hand, and grasped his blade;
      That sound had burst his waking dream,
      As Slumber starts at owlet's scream.
      The spur hath lanced his courser's sides;
      Away--away--for life he rides:                                    
      Swift as the hurled on high jerreed
      Springs to the touch his startled steed;
      The rock is doubled, and the shore
      Shakes with the clattering tramp no more;
      The crag is won, no more is seen
      His Christian crest and haughty mien.
      'Twas but an instant he restrained
      That fiery barb so sternly reined;
      'Twas but a moment that he stood,
      Then sped as if by Death pursued;                                 
      But in that instant o'er his soul
      Winters of Memory seemed to roll,
      And gather in that drop of time
      A life of pain, an age of crime.
      O'er him who loves, or hates, or fears,
      Such moment pours the grief of years:
      What felt he then, at once opprest
      By all that most distracts the breast?
      That pause, which pondered o'er his fate,
      Oh, who its dreary length shall date!                             
      Though in Time's record nearly nought,
      It was Eternity to Thought!
      For infinite as boundless space
      The thought that Conscience must embrace,
      Which in itself can comprehend
      Woe without name, or hope, or end.

        The hour is past, the Giaour is gone:
      And did he fly or fall alone?
      Woe to that hour he came or went!
      The curse for Hassan's sin was sent                               
      To turn a palace to a tomb;
      He came, he went, like the Simoom,
      That harbinger of Fate and gloom,
      Beneath whose widely-wasting breath
      The very cypress droops to death--
    Dark tree, still sad when others' grief is fled,
    The only constant mourner o'er the dead!

        The steed is vanished from the stall;
      No serf is seen in Hassan's hall;
      The lonely Spider's thin gray pall                            
      Waves slowly widening o'er the wall;
      The Bat builds in his Haram bower,
      And in the fortress of his power
      The Owl usurps the beacon-tower;
      The wild-dog howls o'er the fountain's brim,
      With baffled thirst, and famine, grim;
    For the stream has shrunk from its marble bed,
    Where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread.
      'Twas sweet of yore to see it play
      And chase the sultriness of day,                                  
      As springing high the silver dew
      In whirls fantastically flew,
      And flung luxurious coolness round
      The air, and verdure o'er the ground.
      'Twas sweet, when cloudless stars were bright,
      To view the wave of watery light,
      And hear its melody by night.
      And oft had Hassan's Childhood played
      Around the verge of that cascade;
      And oft upon his mother's breast                                  
      That sound had harmonized his rest;
      And oft had Hassan's Youth along
      Its bank been soothed by Beauty's song;
      And softer seemed each melting tone
      Of Music mingled with its own.
      But ne'er shall Hassan's Age repose
      Along the brink at Twilight's close:
      The stream that filled that font is fled--
      The blood that warmed his heart is shed!
      And here no more shall human voice                                
      Be heard to rage, regret, rejoice.
      The last sad note that swelled the gale
      Was woman's wildest funeral wail:
      That quenched in silence, all is still,
      But the lattice that flaps when the wind is shrill:
      Though raves the gust, and floods the rain,
      No hand shall close its clasp again.
      On desert sands 'twere joy to scan
      The rudest steps of fellow man,
      So here the very voice of Grief                                   
      Might wake an Echo like relief--
      At least 'twould say, "All are not gone;
      There lingers Life, though but in one"--
      For many a gilded chamber's there,
      Which Solitude might well forbear;
      Within that dome as yet Decay
      Hath slowly worked her cankering way--
      But gloom is gathered o'er the gate,
      Nor there the Fakir's self will wait;
      Nor there will wandering Dervise stay,                            
      For Bounty cheers not his delay;
      Nor there will weary stranger halt
      To bless the sacred "bread and salt."
        Alike must Wealth and Poverty
        Pass heedless and unheeded by,
        For Courtesy and Pity died
        With Hassan on the mountain side.
        His roof, that refuge unto men,
        Is Desolation's hungry den.
    The guest flies the hall, and the vassal from labour,               
    Since his turban was cleft by the infidel's sabre!

                                       

          I hear the sound of coming feet,
        But not a voice mine ear to greet;
        More near--each turban I can scan,
        And silver-sheath?d ataghan;
        The foremost of the band is seen
        An Emir by his garb of green:
    "Ho! who art thou?"--"This low salam
    Replies of Moslem faith I am.
    The burthen ye so gently bear,                                      
    Seems one that claims your utmost care,
    And, doubtless, holds some precious freight--
    My humble bark would gladly wait."

      "Thou speakest sooth: thy skiff unmoor,
    And waft us from the silent shore;
    Nay, leave the sail still furled, and ply
    The nearest oar that's scattered by,
    And midway to those rocks where sleep
    The channelled waters dark and deep.
    Rest from your task--so--bravely done,                              
    Our course has been right swiftly run;
    Yet 'tis the longest voyage, I trow,
    That one of--    "

                                       

      Sullen it plunged, and slowly sank,
    The calm wave rippled to the bank;
    I watched it as it sank, methought
    Some motion from the current caught
    Bestirred it more,--'twas but the beam
    That checkered o'er the living stream:
    I gazed, till vanishing from view,                                  
    Like lessening pebble it withdrew;
    Still less and less, a speck of white
    That gemmed the tide, then mocked the sight;
    And all its hidden secrets sleep,
    Known but to Genii of the deep,
    Which, trembling in their coral caves,
    They dare not whisper to the waves.

                                       

      As rising on its purple wing
    The insect-queen of Eastern spring,
    O'er emerald meadows of Kashmeer                                    
    Invites the young pursuer near,
    And leads him on from flower to flower
    A weary chase and wasted hour,
    Then leaves him, as it soars on high,
    With panting heart and tearful eye:
    So Beauty lures the full-grown child,
    With hue as bright, and wing as wild:
    A chase of idle hopes and fears,
    Begun in folly, closed in tears.
    If won, to equal ills betrayed,                                 
    Woe waits the insect and the maid;
    A life of pain, the loss of peace;
    From infant's play, and man's caprice:
    The lovely toy so fiercely sought
    Hath lost its charm by being caught,
    For every touch that wooed its stay
    Hath brushed its brightest hues away,
    Till charm, and hue, and beauty gone,
    'Tis left to fly or fall alone.
    With wounded wing, or bleeding breast,                              
    Ah! where shall either victim rest?
    Can this with faded pinion soar
    From rose to tulip as before?
    Or Beauty, blighted in an hour,
    Find joy within her broken bower?
    No: gayer insects fluttering by
    Ne'er droop the wing o'er those that die,
    And lovelier things have mercy shown
    To every failing but their own,
    And every woe a tear can claim                                      
    Except an erring Sister's shame.

                                       

    The Mind, that broods o'er guilty woes,
      Is like the Scorpion girt by fire;
    In circle narrowing as it glows,
    The flames around their captive close,
    Till inly searched by thousand throes,
      And maddening in her ire,
    One sad and sole relief she knows--
    The sting she nourished for her foes,
    Whose venom never yet was vain,                                     
    Gives but one pang, and cures all pain,
    And darts into her desperate brain:
    So do the dark in soul expire,
    Or live like Scorpion girt by fire;
    So writhes the mind Remorse hath riven,
    Unfit for earth, undoomed for heaven,
    Darkness above, despair beneath,
    Around it flame, within it death!

                                       

      Black Hassan from the Haram flies,
    Nor bends on woman's form his eyes;                                 
    The unwonted chase each hour employs,
    Yet shares he not the hunter's joys.
    Not thus was Hassan wont to fly
    When Leila dwelt in his Serai.
    Doth Leila there no longer dwell?
    That tale can only Hassan tell:
    Strange rumours in our city say
    Upon that eve she fled away
    When Rhamazan's last sun was set,
    And flashing from each Minaret                                      
    Millions of lamps proclaimed the feast
    Of Bairam through the boundless East.
    'Twas then she went as to the bath,
    Which Hassan vainly searched in wrath;
    For she was flown her master's rage
    In likeness of a Georgian page,
    And far beyond the Moslem's power
    Had wronged him with the faithless Giaour.
    Somewhat of this had Hassan deemed;
    But still so fond, so fair she seemed,                              
    Too well he trusted to the slave
    Whose treachery deserved a grave:
    And on that eve had gone to Mosque,
    And thence to feast in his Kiosk.
    Such is the tale his Nubians tell,
    Who did not watch their charge too well;
    But others say, that on that night,
    By pale Phingari's trembling light,
    The Giaour upon his jet-black steed
    Was seen, but seen alone to speed                                   
    With bloody spur along the shore,
    Nor maid nor page behind him bore.

                                       

      Her eye's dark charm 'twere vain to tell,
    But gaze on that of the Gazelle,
    It will assist thy fancy well;
    As large, as languishingly dark,
    But Soul beamed forth in every spark
    That darted from beneath the lid,
    Bright as the jewel of Giamschid.
    Yea, Soul, and should our prophet say                             
    That form was nought but breathing clay,
    By Alla! I would answer nay;
    Though on Al-Sirat's arch I stood,
    Which totters o'er the fiery flood,
    With Paradise within my view,
    And all his Houris beckoning through.
    Oh! who young Leila's glance could read
    And keep that portion of his creed
    Which saith that woman is but dust,
    A soulless toy for tyrant's lust?                               
    On her might Muftis gaze, and own
    That through her eye the Immortal shone;
    On her fair cheek's unfading hue
    The young pomegranate's blossoms strew
    Their bloom in blushes ever new;
    Her hair in hyacinthine flow,
    When left to roll its folds below,
    As midst her handmaids in the hall
    She stood superior to them all,
    Hath swept the marble where her feet                                
    Gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet
    Ere from the cloud that gave it birth
    It fell, and caught one stain of earth.
    The cygnet nobly walks the water;
    So moved on earth Circassia's daughter,
    The loveliest bird of Franguestan!
    As rears her crest the ruffled Swan,
      And spurns the wave with wings of pride,
    When pass the steps of stranger man
      Along the banks that bound her tide;                              
    Thus rose fair Leila's whiter neck:--
    Thus armed with beauty would she check
    Intrusion's glance, till Folly's gaze
    Shrunk from the charms it meant to praise.
    Thus high and graceful was her gait;
    Her heart as tender to her mate;
    Her mate--stern Hassan, who was he?
    Alas! that name was not for thee!

                                       

      Stern Hassan hath a journey ta'en
    With twenty vassals in his train,                                   
    Each armed, as best becomes a man,
    With arquebuss and ataghan;
    The chief before, as decked for war,
    Bears in his belt the scimitar
    Stained with the best of Arnaut blood,
    When in the pass the rebels stood,
    And few returned to tell the tale
    Of what befell in Parne's vale.
    The pistols which his girdle bore
    Were those that once a Pasha wore,                                  
    Which still, though gemmed and bossed with gold,
    Even robbers tremble to behold.
    'Tis said he goes to woo a bride
    More true than her who left his side;
    The faithless slave that broke her bower,
    And--worse than faithless--for a Giaour!

                                       

      The sun's last rays are on the hill,
    And sparkle in the fountain rill,
    Whose welcome waters, cool and clear,
    Draw blessings from the mountaineer:                                
    Here may the loitering merchant Greek
    Find that repose 'twere vain to seek
    In cities lodged too near his lord,
    And trembling for his secret hoard--
    Here may he rest where none can see,
    In crowds a slave, in deserts free;
    And with forbidden wine may stain
    The bowl a Moslem must not drain

                                       

      The foremost Tartar's in the gap
    Conspicuous by his yellow cap;                                      
    The rest in lengthening line the while
    Wind slowly through the long defile:
    Above, the mountain rears a peak,
    Where vultures whet the thirsty beak,
    And theirs may be a feast to-night,
    Shall tempt them down ere morrow's light;
    Beneath, a river's wintry stream
    Has shrunk before the summer beam,
    And left a channel bleak and bare,
    Save shrubs that spring to perish there:                            
    Each side the midway path there lay
    Small broken crags of granite gray,
    By time, or mountain lightning, riven
    From summits clad in mists of heaven;
    For where is he that hath beheld
    The peak of Liakura unveiled?

                                       

      They reach the grove of pine at last;
    "Bismillah! now the peril's past;
    For yonder view the opening plain,
    And there we'll prick our steeds amain:"                            
    The Chiaus spake, and as he said,
    A bullet whistled o'er his head;
    The foremost Tartar bites the ground!
      Scarce had they time to check the rein,
    Swift from their steeds the riders bound;
      But three shall never mount again:
    Unseen the foes that gave the wound,
      The dying ask revenge in vain.
    With steel unsheathed, and carbine bent,
    Some o'er their courser's harness leant,                            
      Half sheltered by the steed;
    Some fly beneath the nearest rock,
    And there await the coming shock,
      Nor tamely stand to bleed
    Beneath the shaft of foes unseen,
    Who dare not quit their craggy screen.
    Stern Hassan only from his horse
    Disdains to light, and keeps his course,
    Till fiery flashes in the van
    Proclaim too sure the robber-clan                                   
    Have well secured the only way
    Could now avail the promised prey;
    Then curled his very beard with ire,
    And glared his eye with fiercer fire;
    "Though far and near the bullets hiss,
    I've scaped a bloodier hour than this."
    And now the foe their covert quit,
    And call his vassals to submit;
    But Hassan's frown and furious word
    Are dreaded more than hostile sword,                                
    Nor of his little band a man
    Resigned carbine or ataghan,
    Nor raised the craven cry, Amaun!
    In fuller sight, more near and near,
    The lately ambushed foes appear,
    And, issuing from the grove, advance
    Some who on battle-charger prance.
    Who leads them on with foreign brand
    Far flashing in his red right hand?
    "'Tis he!'tis he! I know him now;                                   
    I know him by his pallid brow;
    I know him by the evil eye
    That aids his envious treachery;
    I know him by his jet-black barb;
    Though now arrayed in Arnaut garb,
    Apostate from his own vile faith,
    It shall not save him from the death:
    'Tis he! well met in any hour,
    Lost Leila's love--accursed Giaour!"

      As rolls the river into Ocean,                                
    In sable torrent wildly streaming;
      As the sea-tide's opposing motion,
    In azure column proudly gleaming,
    Beats back the current many a rood,
    In curling foam and mingling flood,
    While eddying whirl, and breaking wave,
    Roused by the blast of winter, rave;
    Through sparkling spray, in thundering clash,
    The lightnings of the waters flash
    In awful whiteness o'er the shore,                                  
    That shines and shakes beneath the roar;
    Thus--as the stream and Ocean greet,
    With waves that madden as they meet--
    Thus join the bands, whom mutual wrong,
    And fate, and fury, drive along.
    The bickering sabres' shivering jar;
      And pealing wide or ringing near
      Its echoes on the throbbing ear,
    The deathshot hissing from afar;
    The shock, the shout, the groan of war,                             
      Reverberate along that vale,
      More suited to the shepherd's tale:
    Though few the numbers--theirs the strife,
    That neither spares nor speaks for life!
    Ah! fondly youthful hearts can press,
    To seize and share the dear caress;
    But Love itself could never pant
    For all that Beauty sighs to grant
    With half the fervour Hate bestows
    Upon the last embrace of foes,                                      
    When grappling in the fight they fold
    Those arms that ne'er shall lose their hold:
    Friends meet to part; Love laughs at faith;
    True foes, once met, are joined till death!

                                       

      With sabre shivered to the hilt,
    Yet dripping with the blood he spilt;
    Yet strained within the severed hand
    Which quivers round that faithless brand;
    His turban far behind him rolled,
    And cleft in twain its firmest fold;                                
    His flowing robe by falchion torn,
    And crimson as those clouds of morn
    That, streaked with dusky red, portend
    The day shall have a stormy end;
    A stain on every bush that bore
    A fragment of his palampore;
    His breast with wounds unnumbered riven,
    His back to earth, his face to Heaven,
    Fall'n Hassan lies--his unclosed eye
    Yet lowering on his enemy,                                          
    As if the hour that sealed his fate
    Surviving left his quenchless hate;
    And o'er him bends that foe with brow
    As dark as his that bled below.

                                       

      "Yes, Leila sleeps beneath the wave,
    But his shall be a redder grave;
    Her spirit pointed well the steel
    Which taught that felon heart to feel.
    He called the Prophet, but his power
    Was vain against the vengeful Giaour:                               
    He called on Alla--but the word
    Arose unheeded or unheard.
    Thou Paynim fool! could Leila's prayer
    Be passed, and thine accorded there?
    I watched my time, I leagued with these,
    The traitor in his turn to seize;
    My wrath is wreaked, the deed is done,
    And now I go--but go alone."

                                       

                                       

      The browsing camels' bells are tinkling:
    His mother looked from her lattice high--                      
      She saw the dews of eve besprinkling
    The pasture green beneath her eye,
      She saw the planets faintly twinkling:
    "'Tis twilight--sure his train is nigh."
    She could not rest in the garden-bower,
    But gazed through the grate of his steepest tower.
    "Why comes he not? his steeds are fleet,
    Nor shrink they from the summer heat;
    Why sends not the Bridegroom his promised gift?
    Is his heart more cold, or his barb less swift?                     
    Oh, false reproach! yon Tartar now
    Has gained our nearest mountain's brow,
    And warily the steep descends,
    And now within the valley bends;
    And he bears the gift at his saddle bow--
    How could I deem his courser slow?
    Right well my largess shall repay
    His welcome speed, and weary way."

      The Tartar lighted at the gate,
    But scarce upheld his fainting weight!                          
    His swarthy visage spake distress,
    But this might be from weariness;
    His garb with sanguine spots was dyed,
    But these might be from his courser's side;
    He drew the token from his vest--
    Angel of Death! 'tis Hassan's cloven crest!
    His calpac rent--his caftan red--
    "Lady, a fearful bride thy Son hath wed:
    Me, not from mercy, did they spare,
    But this empurpled pledge to bear.                                  
    Peace to the brave! whose blood is spilt:
    Woe to the Giaour! for his the guilt."

                                       

      A Turban carved in coarsest stone,
    A Pillar with rank weeds o'ergrown,
    Whereon can now be scarcely read
    The Koran verse that mourns the dead,
    Point out the spot where Hassan fell
    A victim in that lonely dell.
    There sleeps as true an Osmanlie
    As e'er at Mecca bent the knee;                                     
    As ever scorned forbidden wine,
    Or prayed with face towards the shrine,
    In orisons resumed anew
    At solemn sound of "Alla Hu!"
    Yet died he by a stranger's hand,
    And stranger in his native land;
    Yet died he as in arms he stood,
    And unavenged, at least in blood.
    But him the maids of Paradise
      Impatient to their halls invite,                                  
    And the dark heaven of Houris' eyes
      On him shall glance for ever bright;
    They come--their kerchiefs green they wave,
    And welcome with a kiss the brave!
    Who falls in battle 'gainst a Giaour
    Is worthiest an immortal bower.

                                       

      But thou, false Infidel! shall writhe
    Beneath avenging Monkir's scythe;
    And from its torments 'scape alone
    To wander round lost Eblis' throne;                            
    And fire unquenched, unquenchable,
    Around, within, thy heart shall dwell;
    Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell
    The tortures of that inward hell!
    But first, on earth as Vampire sent,
    Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent:
    Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
    And suck the blood of all thy race;
    There from thy daughter, sister, wife,
    At midnight drain the stream of life;                               
    Yet loathe the banquet which perforce
    Must feed thy livid living corse:
    Thy victims ere they yet expire
    Shall know the demon for their sire,
    As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
    Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
    But one that for thy crime must fall,
    The youngest, most beloved of all,
    Shall bless thee with a father's name--
    That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!                            
    Yet must thou end thy task, and mark
    Her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark,
    And the last glassy glance must view
    Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
    Then with unhallowed hand shalt tear
    The tresses of her yellow hair,
    Of which in life a lock when shorn
    Affection's fondest pledge was worn,
    But now is borne away by thee,
    Memorial of thine agony!                                            
    Wet with thine own best blood shall drip
    Thy gnashing tooth and haggard lip;
    Then stalking to thy sullen grave,
    Go--and with Gouls and Afrits rave;
    Till these in horror shrink away
    From Spectre more accursed than they!

                                       

    "How name ye yon lone Caloyer?
      His features I have scanned before
    In mine own land: 'tis many a year,
      Since, dashing by the lonely shore,                               
    I saw him urge as fleet a steed
    As ever served a horseman's need.
    But once I saw that face, yet then
    It was so marked with inward pain,
    I could not pass it by again;
    It breathes the same dark spirit now,
    As death were stamped upon his brow.

    "'Tis twice three years at summer tide
      Since first among our freres he came;
    And here it soothes him to abide                                    
      For some dark deed he will not name.
    But never at our Vesper prayer,
    Nor e'er before Confession chair
    Kneels he, nor recks he when arise
    Incense or anthem to the skies,
    But broods within his cell alone,
    His faith and race alike unknown.
    The sea from Paynim land he crost,
    And here ascended from the coast;
    Yet seems he not of Othman race,                                    
    But only Christian in his face:
    I'd judge him some stray renegade,
    Repentant of the change he made,
    Save that he shuns our holy shrine,
    Nor tastes the sacred bread and wine.
    Great largess to these walls he brought,
    And thus our Abbot's favour bought;
    But were I Prior, not a day
    Should brook such stranger's further stay,
    Or pent within our penance cell                                     
    Should doom him there for aye to dwell.
    Much in his visions mutters he
    Of maiden whelmed beneath the sea;
    Of sabres clashing, foemen flying,
    Wrongs avenged, and Moslem dying.
    On cliff he hath been known to stand,
    And rave as to some bloody hand
    Fresh severed from its parent limb,
    Invisible to all but him,
    Which beckons onward to his grave,                                  
    And lures to leap into the wave."

                                       

                                       

      Dark and unearthly is the scowl
    That glares beneath his dusky cowl:
    The flash of that dilating eye
    Reveals too much of times gone by;
    Though varying, indistinct its hue,
    Oft with his glance the gazer rue,
    For in it lurks that nameless spell,
    Which speaks, itself unspeakable,
    A spirit yet unquelled and high,                                    
    That claims and keeps ascendancy;
    And like the bird whose pinions quake,
    But cannot fly the gazing snake,
    Will others quail beneath his look,
    Nor 'scape the glance they scarce can brook.
    From him the half-affrighted Friar
    When met alone would fain retire,
    As if that eye and bitter smile
    Transferred to others fear and guile:
    Not oft to smile descendeth he,                                     
    And when he doth 'tis sad to see
    That he but mocks at Misery.
    How that pale lip will curl and quiver!
    Then fix once more as if for ever;
    As if his sorrow or disdain
    Forbade him e'er to smile again.
    Well were it so--such ghastly mirth
    From joyaunce ne'er derived its birth.
    But sadder still it were to trace
    What once were feelings in that face:                               
    Time hath not yet the features fixed,
    But brighter traits with evil mixed;
    And there are hues not always faded,
    Which speak a mind not all degraded
    Even by the crimes through which it waded:
    The common crowd but see the gloom
    Of wayward deeds, and fitting doom;
    The close observer can espy
    A noble soul, and lineage high:
    Alas! though both bestowed in vain,                                 
    Which Grief could change, and Guilt could stain,
    It was no vulgar tenement
    To which such lofty gifts were lent,
    And still with little less than dread
    On such the sight is riveted.
    The roofless cot, decayed and rent,
      Will scarce delay the passer-by;
    The tower by war or tempest bent,
    While yet may frown one battlement,
      Demands and daunts the stranger's eye;                            
    Each ivied arch, and pillar lone,
    Pleads haughtily for glories gone!
    "His floating robe around him folding,
      Slow sweeps he through the columned aisle;
    With dread beheld, with gloom beholding
      The rites that sanctify the pile.
    But when the anthem shakes the choir,
    And kneel the monks, his steps retire;
    By yonder lone and wavering torch
    His aspect glares within the porch;                                 
    There will he pause till all is done--
    And hear the prayer, but utter none.
    See--by the half-illumined wall
    His hood fly back, his dark hair fall,
    That pale brow wildly wreathing round,
    As if the Gorgon there had bound
    The sablest of the serpent-braid
    That o'er her fearful forehead strayed:
    For he declines the convent oath,
    And leaves those locks unhallowed growth,                           
    But wears our garb in all beside;
    And, not from piety but pride,
    Gives wealth to walls that never heard
    Of his one holy vow nor word.
    Lo!--mark ye, as the harmony
    Peals louder praises to the sky,
    That livid cheek, that stony air
    Of mixed defiance and despair!
    Saint Francis, keep him from the shrine!
    Else may we dread the wrath divine                                  
    Made manifest by awful sign.
    If ever evil angel bore
    The form of mortal, such he wore;
    By all my hope of sins forgiven,
    Such looks are not of earth nor heaven!"

      To Love the softest hearts are prone,
    But such can ne'er be all his own;
    Too timid in his woes to share,
    Too meek to meet, or brave despair;
    And sterner hearts alone may feel                                   
    The wound that Time can never heal.
    The rugged metal of the mine
    Must burn before its surface shine,
    But plunged within the furnace-flame,
    It bends and melts--though still the same;
    Then tempered to thy want, or will,
    'Twill serve thee to defend or kill--
    A breast-plate for thine hour of need,
    Or blade to bid thy foeman bleed;
    But if a dagger's form it bear,                                     
    Let those who shape its edge, beware!
    Thus Passion's fire, and Woman's art,
    Can turn and tame the sterner heart;
    From these its form and tone are ta'en,
    And what they make it, must remain,
    But break--before it bend again.

                                       

                                       

      If solitude succeed to grief,
    Release from pain is slight relief;
    The vacant bosom's wilderness
    Might thank the pang that made it less.                        
    We loathe what none are left to share:
    Even bliss--'twere woe alone to bear;
    The heart once left thus desolate
    Must fly at last for ease--to hate.
    It is as if the dead could feel
    The icy worm around them steal,
    And shudder, as the reptiles creep
    To revel o'er their rotting sleep,
    Without the power to scare away
    The cold consumers of their clay!                                   
    It is as if the desert bird,
      Whose beak unlocks her bosom's stream
      To still her famished nestlings' scream,
    Nor mourns a life to them transferred,
    Should rend her rash devoted breast,
    And find them flown her empty nest.
    The keenest pangs the wretched find
      Are rapture to the dreary void,
    The leafless desert of the mind,
      The waste of feelings unemployed.                                 
    Who would be doomed to gaze upon
    A sky without a cloud or sun?
    Less hideous far the tempest's roar,
    Than ne'er to brave the billows more--
    Thrown, when the war of winds is o'er,
    A lonely wreck on Fortune's shore,
    'Mid sullen calm, and silent bay,
    Unseen to drop by dull decay;--
    Better to sink beneath the shock
    Than moulder piecemeal on the rock!                                 

                                       

      "Father! thy, days have passed in peace,
        'Mid counted beads, and countless prayer;
      To bid the sins of others cease,
        Thyself without a crime or care,
      Save transient ills that all must bear,
      Has been thy lot from youth to age;
      And thou wilt bless thee from the rage
      Of passions fierce and uncontrolled,
      Such as thy penitents unfold,
      Whose secret sins and sorrows rest                                
      Within thy pure and pitying breast.
      My days, though few, have passed below
      In much of Joy, but more of Woe;
      Yet still in hours of love or strife,
      I've 'scaped the weariness of Life:
      Now leagued with friends, now girt by foes,
      I loathed the languor of repose.
      Now nothing left to love or hate,
      No more with hope or pride elate,
      I'd rather be the thing that crawls                               
      Most noxious o'er a dungeon's walls,
      Than pass my dull, unvarying days,
      Condemned to meditate and gaze.
      Yet, lurks a wish within my breast
      For rest--but not to feel 'tis rest.
      Soon shall my Fate that wish fulfil;
        And I shall sleep without the dream
      Of what I was, and would be still
        Dark as to thee my deeds may seem:
      My memory now is but the tomb                                    
      Of joys long dead; my hope, their doom:
      'Though better to have died with those
      Than bear a life of lingering woes.
      My spirit shrunk not to sustain
      The searching throes of ceaseless pain;
      Nor sought the self-accorded grave
      Of ancient fool and modern knave:
      Yet death I have not feared to meet;
      And in the field it had been sweet,
      Had Danger wooed me on to move                                   
      The slave of Glory, not of Love.
      I've braved it--not for Honour's boast;
      I smile at laurels won or lost;
      To such let others carve their way,
      For high renown, or hireling pay:
      But place again before my eyes
      Aught that I deem a worthy prize--
      The maid I love, the man I hate--
      And I will hunt the steps of fate,
      To save or slay, as these require,                               
      Through rending steel, and rolling fire:
      Nor needst thou doubt this speech from one
      Who would but do--what he hath done.
      Death is but what the haughty brave,
      The weak must bear, the wretch must crave;
      Then let life go to Him who gave:
      I have not quailed to Danger's brow
      When high and happy--need I now?

                                       

      "I loved her, Friar! nay, adored--
        But these are words that all can use--                         
      I proved it more in deed than word;
      There's blood upon that dinted sword,
        A stain its steel can never lose:
      'Twas shed for her, who died for me,
        It warmed the heart of one abhorred:
      Nay, start not--no--nor bend thy knee,
        Nor midst my sin such act record;
      Thou wilt absolve me from the deed,
      For he was hostile to thy creed!
      The very name of Nazarene                                        
      Was wormwood to his Paynim spleen.
      Ungrateful fool! since but for brands
      Well wielded in some hardy hands,
      And wounds by Galileans given--
      The surest pass to Turkish heaven--
      For him his Houris still might wait
      Impatient at the Prophet's gate.
      I loved her--Love will find its way
      Through paths where wolves would fear to prey;
      And if it dares enough,'twere hard                               
      If Passion met not some reward--
      No matter how, or where, or why,
      I did not vainly seek, nor sigh:
      Yet sometimes, with remorse, in vain
      I wish she had not loved again.
      She died--I dare not tell thee how;
      But look--'tis written on my brow!
      There read of Cain the curse and crime,
      In characters unworn by Time:
      Still, ere thou dost condemn me, pause;                          
      Not mine the act, though I the cause.
      Yet did he but what I had done
      Had she been false to more than one.
      Faithless to him--he gave the blow;
      But true to me--I laid him low:
      Howe'er deserved her doom might be,
      Her treachery was truth to me;
      To me she gave her heart, that all
      Which Tyranny can ne'er enthrall;
      And I, alas! too late to save!                                   
      Yet all I then could give, I gave--
      'Twas some relief--our foe a grave.
      His death sits lightly; but her fate
      Has made me--what thou well mayst hate.
        His doom was sealed--he knew it well,
      Warned by the voice of stern Taheer,
      Deep in whose darkly boding ear
      The deathshot pealed of murder near,
        As filed the troop to where they fell!
      He died too in the battle broil,                                 
      A time that heeds nor pain nor toil;
      One cry to Mahomet for aid,
      One prayer to Alla all he made:
      He knew and crossed me in the fray--
      I gazed upon him where he lay,
      And watched his spirit ebb away:
      Though pierced like pard by hunter's steel,
      He felt not half that now I feel.
      I searched, but vainly searched, to find
      The workings of a wounded mind;                                  
      Each feature of that sullen corse
      Betrayed his rage, but no remorse.
      Oh, what had Vengeance given to trace
      Despair upon his dying face!
      The late repentance of that hour
      When Penitence hath lost her power
      To tear one terror from the grave,
      And will not soothe, and cannot save.

                                       

      "The cold in clime are cold in blood,
      Their love can scarce deserve the name;                          
      But mine was like the lava flood
        That boils in ?tna's breast of flame.
      I cannot prate in puling strain
      Of Ladye-love, and Beauty's chain:
      If changing cheek, and scorching vein,
      Lips taught to writhe, but not complain,
      If bursting heart, and maddening brain,
      And daring deed, and vengeful steel,
      And all that I have felt, and feel,
      Betoken love--that love was mine,                                
      And shown by many a bitter sign.
      'Tis true, I could not whine nor sigh,
      I knew but to obtain or die.
      I die--but first I have possessed,
      And come what may, I have been blessed.
      Shall I the doom I sought upbraid?
      No--reft of all, yet undismayed
      But for the thought of Leila slain,
      Give me the pleasure with the pain,
      So would I live and love again.                                  
      I grieve, but not, my holy Guide!
      For him who dies, but her who died:
      She sleeps beneath the wandering wave--
      Ah! had she but an earthly grave,
      This breaking heart and throbbing head
      Should seek and share her narrow bed.
      She was a form of Life and Light,
      That, seen, became a part of sight;
      And rose, where'er I turned mine eye,
      The Morning-star of Memory!                                      

      "Yes, Love indeed is light from heaven;
        A spark of that immortal fire
      With angels shared, by Alia given,
        To lift from earth our low desire.
      Devotion wafts the mind above,
      But Heaven itself descends in Love;
      A feeling from the Godhead caught,
      To wean from self each sordid thought;
      A ray of Him who formed the whole;
      A Glory circling round the soul!                                 
      I grant my love imperfect, all
      That mortals by the name miscall;
      Then deem it evil, what thou wilt;
      But say, oh say, hers was not Guilt!
      She was my Life's unerring Light:
      That quenched--what beam shall break my night?
      Oh! would it shone to lead me still,
      Although to death or deadliest ill!
      Why marvel ye, if they who lose
        This present joy, this future hope,                            
        No more with Sorrow meekly cope;
      In phrensy then their fate accuse;
      In madness do those fearful deeds
        That seem to add but Guilt to Woe?
      Alas! the breast that inly bleeds
        Hath nought to dread from outward blow:
      Who falls from all he knows of bliss,
      Cares little into what abyss.
      Fierce as the gloomy vulture's now
        To thee, old man, my deeds appear:                             
      I read abhorrence on thy brow,
        And this too was I born to bear!
      'Tis true, that, like that bird of prey,
      With havock have I marked my way:
      But this was taught me by the dove,
      To die--and know no second love.
      This lesson yet hath man to learn,
      Taught by the thing he dares to spurn:
      The bird that sings within the brake,
      The swan that swims upon the lake,                               
      One mate, and one alone, will take.
      And let the fool still prone to range,
      And sneer on all who cannot change,
      Partake his jest with boasting boys;
      I envy not his varied joys,
      But deem such feeble, heartless man,
      Less than yon solitary swan;
      Far, far beneath the shallow maid
      He left believing and betrayed.
      Such shame at least was never mine--                             
      Leila! each thought was only thine!
      My good, my guilt, my weal, my woe,
      My hope on high--my all below.
      Each holds no other like to thee,
      Or, if it doth, in vain for me:
      For worlds I dare not view the dame
      Resembling thee, yet not the same.
      The very crimes that mar my youth,
      This bed of death--attest my truth!
      'Tis all too late--thou wert, thou art                           
      The cherished madness of my heart!

      "And she was lost--and yet I breathed,
        But not the breath of human life:
      A serpent round my heart was wreathed,
        And stung my every thought to strife.
      Alike all time, abhorred all place,
      Shuddering I shrank from Nature's face,
      Where every hue that charmed before
      The blackness of my bosom wore.
      The rest thou dost already know,                                 
      And all my sins, and half my woe.
      But talk no more of penitence;
      Thou seest I soon shall part from hence:
      And if thy holy tale were true,
      The deed that's done canst thou undo?
      Think me not thankless--but this grief
      Looks not to priesthood for relief.
      My soul's estate in secret guess:
      But wouldst thou pity more, say less.
      When thou canst bid my Leila live,                               
      Then will I sue thee to forgive;
      Then plead my cause in that high place
      Where purchased masses proffer grace.
      Go, when the hunter's hand hath wrung
      From forest-cave her shrieking young,
      And calm the lonely lioness:
    But soothe not--mock not my distress!

      "In earlier days, and calmer hours,
        When heart with heart delights to blend,
      Where bloom my native valley's bowers,                       
        I had--Ah! have I now?--a friend!
      To him this pledge I charge thee send,
        Memorial of a youthful vow;
      I would remind him of my end:
        Though souls absorbed like mine allow
      Brief thought to distant Friendship's claim,
      Yet dear to him my blighted name.
      'Tis strange--he prophesied my doom,
        And I have smiled--I then could smile--
      When Prudence would his voice assume,                            
        And warn--I recked not what--the while:
      But now Remembrance whispers o'er
      Those accents scarcely marked before.
      Say--that his bodings came to pass,
        And he will start to hear their truth,
        And wish his words had not been sooth:
      Tell him--unheeding as I was,
        Through many a busy bitter scene
        Of all our golden youth had been,
      In pain, my faltering tongue had tried                           
      To bless his memory--ere I died;
      But Heaven in wrath would turn away,
      If Guilt should for the guiltless pray.
      I do not ask him not to blame,
      Too gentle he to wound my name;
      And what have I to do with Fame?
      I do not ask him not to mourn,
      Such cold request might sound like scorn;
      And what than Friendship's manly tear
      May better grace a brother's bier?                               
      But bear this ring, his own of old,
      And tell him--what thou dost behold!
      The withered frame, the ruined mind,
      The wrack by passion left behind,
      A shrivelled scroll, a scattered leaf,
      Seared by the autumn blast of Grief!

                                       

        "Tell me no more of Fancy's gleam,
      No, father, no,'twas not a dream;
      Alas! the dreamer first must sleep,
      I only watched, and wished to weep;                              
      But could not, for my burning brow
      Throbbed to the very brain as now:
      I wished but for a single tear,
      As something welcome, new, and dear:
      I wished it then, I wish it still;
      Despair is stronger than my will.
      Waste not thine orison, despair
      Is mightier than thy pious prayer:
      I would not, if I might, be blest;
      I want no Paradise, but rest.                                    
      'Twas then--I tell thee--father! then
      I saw her; yes, she lived again;
      And shining in her white symar
      As through yon pale gray cloud the star
      Which now I gaze on, as on her,
      Who looked and looks far lovelier;
      Dimly I view its trembling spark;
      To-morrow's night shall be more dark;
      And I, before its rays appear,
      That lifeless thing the living fear.                             
      I wander--father! for my soul
      Is fleeting towards the final goal.
      I saw her--friar! and I rose
      Forgetful of our former woes;
      And rushing from my couch, I dart,
      And clasp her to my desperate heart;
      I clasp--what is it that I clasp?
      No breathing form within my grasp,
      No heart that beats reply to mine--
      Yet, Leila! yet the form is thine!                               
      And art thou, dearest, changed so much
      As meet my eye, yet mock my touch?
      Ah! were thy beauties e'er so cold,
      I care not--so my arms enfold
      The all they ever wished to hold.
      Alas! around a shadow prest
      They shrink upon my lonely breast;
      Yet still 'tis there! In silence stands,
      And beckons with beseeching hands!
      With braided hair, and bright-black eye--                        
      I knew 'twas false--she could not die!
      But he is dead! within the dell
      I saw him buried where he fell;
      He comes not--for he cannot break
      From earth;--why then art thou awake?
      They told me wild waves rolled above
      The face I view--the form I love;
      They told me--'twas a hideous tale!--
      I'd tell it, but my tongue would fail:
      If true, and from thine ocean-cave                               
      Thou com'st to claim a calmer grave,
      Oh! pass thy dewy fingers o'er
      This brow that then will burn no more;
      Or place them on my hopeless heart:
      But, Shape or Shade! whate'er thou art,
      In mercy ne'er again depart!
      Or farther with thee bear my soul
      Than winds can waft or waters roll!

                                       

      "Such is my name, and such my tale.
        Confessor! to thy secret ear                                   
      I breathe the sorrows I bewail,
        And thank thee for the generous tear
      This glazing eye could never shed.
      Then lay me with the humblest dead,
      And, save the cross above my head,
      Be neither name nor emblem spread,
      By prying stranger to be read,
      Or stay the passing pilgrim's tread."

    He passed--nor of his name and race
    He left a token or a trace,                                        
    Save what the Father must not say
    Who shrived him on his dying day:
    This broken tale was all we knew
    Of her he loved, or him he slew.




                        THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS.



                      CANTO THE FIRST.

                    I.

    Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle
      Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?
    Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,
      Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?
    Know ye the land of the cedar and vine,
    Where the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine;
    Where the light wings of Zephyr, oppressed with perfume,
    Wax faint o'er the gardens of G?l in her bloom;
    Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit,
    And the voice of the nightingale never is mute;                 
    Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky,
    In colour though varied, in beauty may vie,
    And the purple of Ocean is deepest in dye;
    Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine,
    And all, save the spirit of man, is divine--
    Tis the clime of the East--'tis the land of the Sun--
    Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done?
    Oh! wild as the accents of lovers' farewell
    Are the hearts which they bear, and the tales which they tell.

                    II.

        Begirt with many a gallant slave,                                
        Apparelled as becomes the brave,
        Awaiting each his Lord's behest
        To guide his steps, or guard his rest,
        Old Giaffir sate in his Divan:
          Deep thought was in his ag?d eye;
        And though the face of Mussulman
          Not oft betrays to standers by
      The mind within, well skilled to hide
      All but unconquerable pride,
      His pensive cheek and pondering brow                           
      Did more than he was wont avow.

                    III.

    "Let the chamber be cleared."--The train disappeared--
      "Now call me the chief of the Haram guard"--
    With Giaffir is none but his only son,
      And the Nubian awaiting the sire's award.
      "Haroun--when all the crowd that wait
      Are passed beyond the outer gate,
      (Woe to the head whose eye beheld
      My child Zuleika's face unveiled!)
      Hence, lead my daughter from her tower--                       
      Her fate is fixed this very hour;
      Yet not to her repeat my thought--
      By me alone be duty taught!"

      "Pacha! to hear is to obey."--
      No more must slave to despot say--
      Then to the tower had ta'en his way:
      But here young Selim silence brake,
        First lowly rendering reverence meet;
      And downcast looked, and gently spake,
        Still standing at the Pacha's feet:                              
      For son of Moslem must expire,
      Ere dare to sit before his sire!
      "Father! for fear that thou shouldst chide
      My sister, or her sable guide--
      Know--for the fault, if fault there be,
      Was mine--then fall thy frowns on me!
      So lovelily the morning shone,
        That--let the old and weary sleep--
      I could not; and to view alone
        The fairest scenes of land and deep,                             
      With none to listen and reply
      To thoughts with which my heart beat high
      Were irksome--for whate'er my mood,
      In sooth I love not solitude;
      I on Zuleika's slumber broke,
        And, as thou knowest that for me
        Soon turns the Haram's grating key,
      Before the guardian slaves awoke
      We to the cypress groves had flown,
      And made earth, main, and heaven our own!                          
      There lingered we, beguiled too long
      With Mejnoun's tale, or Sadi's song;
      Till I, who heard the deep tambour
      Beat thy Divan's approaching hour,
      To thee, and to my duty true,
      Warned by the sound, to greet thee flew:
      But there Zuleika wanders yet--
      Nay, Father, rage not--nor forget
      That none can pierce that secret bower
      But those who watch the women's tower."                            

                    IV.

    "Son of a slave"--the Pacha said--
    "From unbelieving mother bred,
    Vain were a father's hope to see
    Aught that beseems a man in thee.
    Thou, when thine arm should bend the bow,
      And hurl the dart, and curb the steed,
      Thou, Greek in soul if not in creed,
    Must pore where babbling waters flow,
    And watch unfolding roses blow.
    Would that yon Orb, whose matin glow                                 
    Thy listless eyes so much admire,
    Would lend thee something of his fire!
    Thou, who woulds't see this battlement
    By Christian cannon piecemeal rent;
    Nay, tamely view old Stambol's wall
    Before the dogs of Moscow fall,
    Nor strike one stroke for life and death
    Against the curs of Nazareth!
    Go--let thy less than woman's hand
    Assume the distaff--not the brand.                                  
    But, Haroun!--to my daughter speed:
    And hark--of thine own head take heed--
    If thus Zuleika oft takes wing--
    Thou see'st yon bow--it hath a string!"

                    V.

    No sound from Selim's lip was heard,
      At least that met old Giaffir's ear,
    But every frown and every word
    Pierced keener than a Christian's sword.
      "Son of a slave!--reproached with fear!
      Those gibes had cost another dear.                                
    Son of a slave!--and who my Sire?"
      Thus held his thoughts their dark career;
    And glances ev'n of more than ire
      Flash forth, then faintly disappear.
    Old Giaffir gazed upon his son
      And started; for within his eye
    He read how much his wrath had done;
    He saw rebellion there begun:
      "Come hither, boy--what, no reply?
    I mark thee--and I know thee too;                                   
    But there be deeds thou dar'st not do:
    But if thy beard had manlier length,
    And if thy hand had skill and strength,
    I'd joy to see thee break a lance,
    Albeit against my own perchance."
    As sneeringly these accents fell,
    On Selim's eye he fiercely gazed:
      That eye returned him glance for glance,
    And proudly to his Sire's was raised,
      Till Giaffir's quailed and shrunk askance--                       
    And why--he felt, but durst not tell.
    "Much I misdoubt this wayward boy
    Will one day work me more annoy:
    I never loved him from his birth,
    And--but his arm is little worth,
    And scarcely in the chase could cope
    With timid fawn or antelope,
    Far less would venture into strife
    Where man contends for fame and life--
      I would not trust that look or tone:                              
    No--nor the blood so near my own.
    That blood--he hath not heard--no more--
    I'll watch him closer than before.
    He is an Arab to my sight,
    Or Christian crouching in the fight--
    But hark!--I hear Zuleika's voice;
      Like Houris' hymn it meets mine ear:
    She is the offspring of my choice;
      Oh! more than ev'n her mother dear,
    With all to hope, and nought to fear--                              
    My Peri! ever welcome here!
    Sweet, as the desert fountain's wave
    To lips just cooled in time to save--
      Such to my longing sight art thou;
    Nor can they waft to Mecca's shrine
    More thanks for life, than I for thine,
      Who blest thy birth and bless thee now."

                    VI.

    Fair, as the first that fell of womankind,
      When on that dread yet lovely serpent smiling,
    Whose Image then was stamped upon her mind--                        
      But once beguiled--and ever more beguiling;
    Dazzling, as that, oh! too transcendent vision
      To Sorrow's phantom-peopled slumber given,
    When heart meets heart again in dreams Elysian,
      And paints the lost on Earth revived in Heaven;
    Soft, as the memory of buried love;
    Pure, as the prayer which Childhood wafts above;
    Was she--the daughter of that rude old Chief,
    Who met the maid with tears--but not of grief.

    Who hath not proved how feebly words essay                     
    To fix one spark of Beauty's heavenly ray?
    Who doth not feel, until his failing sight
    Faints into dimness with its own delight,
    His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess
    The might--the majesty of Loveliness?
    Such was Zuleika--such around her shone
    The nameless charms unmarked by her alone--
    The light of Love, the purity of Grace,
    The mind, the Music breathing from her face,
    The heart whose softness harmonized the whole,                      
    And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul!

    Her graceful arms in meekness bending
      Across her gently-budding breast;
    At one kind word those arms extending
      To clasp the neck of him who blest
      His child caressing and carest,
      Zuleika came--and Giaffir felt
      His purpose half within him melt:
      Not that against her fancied weal
      His heart though stern could ever feel;                           
      Affection chained her to that heart;
      Ambition tore the links apart.

                    VII.

    "Zuleika! child of Gentleness!
      How dear this very day must tell,
    When I forget my own distress,
      In losing what I love so well,
    To bid thee with another dwell:
    Another! and a braver man
    Was never seen in battle's van.
    We Moslem reck not much of blood:                                   
      But yet the line of Carasman
    Unchanged, unchangeable hath stood
      First of the bold Timariot bands
    That won and well can keep their lands.
    Enough that he who comes to woo
    Is kinsman of the Bey Oglou:
    His years need scarce a thought employ;
    I would not have thee wed a boy.
    And thou shalt have a noble dower:
    And his and my united power                                         
    Will laugh to scorn the death-firman,
    Which others tremble but to scan,
    And teach the messenger what fate
    The bearer of such boon may wait.
    And now thou know'st thy father's will;
      All that thy sex hath need to know:
    'Twas mine to teach obedience still--
      The way to love, thy Lord may show."

                    VIII.

      In silence bowed the virgin's head;
        And if her eye was filled with tears                            
      That stifled feeling dare not shed,
      And changed her cheek from pale to red,
        And red to pale, as through her ears
      Those wing?d words like arrows sped,
        What could such be but maiden fears?
      So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
      Love half regrets to kiss it dry;
      So sweet the blush of Bashfulness,
      Even Pity scarce can wish it less!

      Whate'er it was the sire forgot:                                  
      Or if remembered, marked it not;
      Thrice clapped his hands, and called his steed,
        Resigned his gem-adorned chibouque,
      And mounting featly for the mead,
        With Maugrabeel and Mamaluke,
        His way amid his Delis took,
      To witness many an active deed
      With sabre keen, or blunt jerreed.
      The Kislar only and his Moors
      Watch well the Haram's massy doors.                               

                    IX.

    His head was leant upon his hand,
      His eye looked o'er the dark blue water
    That swiftly glides and gently swells
    Between the winding Dardanelles;
    But yet he saw nor sea nor strand,
    Nor even his Pacha's turbaned band
      Mix in the game of mimic slaughter,
    Careering cleave the folded felt
    With sabre stroke right sharply dealt;
    Nor marked the javelin-darting crowd,                               
    Nor heard their Ollahs wild and loud--
      He thought but of old Giaffir's daughter!

                    X.

    No word from Selim's bosom broke;
    One sigh Zuleika's thought bespoke:
    Still gazed he through the lattice grate,
    Pale, mute, and mournfully sedate.
    To him Zuleika's eye was turned,
    But little from his aspect learned:
    Equal her grief, yet not the same;
    Her heart confessed a gentler flame:                            
    But yet that heart, alarmed or weak,
    She knew not why, forbade to speak.
    Yet speak she must--but when essay?
    "How strange he thus should turn away!
    Not thus we e'er before have met;
    Not thus shall be our parting yet."
    Thrice paced she slowly through the room,
      And watched his eye--it still was fixed:
      She snatched the urn wherein was mixed
    The Persian Atar-gul's perfume,                                
    And sprinkled all its odours o'er
    The pictured roof and marble floor:
    The drops, that through his glittering vest
    The playful girl's appeal addressed,
    Unheeded o'er his bosom flew,
    As if that breast were marble too.
    "What, sullen yet? it must not be--
    Oh! gentle Selim, this from thee!"
    She saw in curious order set
      The fairest flowers of Eastern land--                             
    "He loved them once; may touch them yet,
      If offered by Zuleika's hand."
    The childish thought was hardly breathed
    Before the rose was plucked and wreathed;
    The next fond moment saw her seat
    Her fairy form at Selim's feet:
    "This rose to calm my brother's cares
    A message from the Bulbul bears;
    It says to-night he will prolong
    For Selim's ear his sweetest song;                                  
    And though his note is somewhat sad,
    He'll try for once a strain more glad,
    With some faint hope his altered lay
    May sing these gloomy thoughts away.

                    XI.

      "What! not receive my foolish flower?
        Nay then I am indeed unblest:
      On me can thus thy forehead lower?
        And know'st thou not who loves thee best?
      Oh, Selim dear! oh, more than dearest!
      Say, is it me thou hat'st or fearest?                             
      Come, lay thy head upon my breast,
      And I will kiss thee into rest,
      Since words of mine, and songs must fail,
      Ev'n from my fabled nightingale.
      I knew our sire at times was stern,
      But this from thee had yet to learn:
      Too well I know he loves thee not;
      But is Zuleika's love forgot?
      Ah! deem I right? the Pacha's plan--
      This kinsman Bey of Carasman                                      
      Perhaps may prove some foe of thine.
      If so, I swear by Mecca's shrine,--
      If shrines that ne'er approach allow
      To woman's step admit her vow,--
      Without thy free consent--command--
      The Sultan should not have my hand!
      Think'st thou that I could bear to part
      With thee, and learn to halve my heart?
      Ah! were I severed from thy side,
      Where were thy friend--and who my guide?                          
      Years have not seen, Time shall not see,
      The hour that tears my soul from thee:
      Ev'n Azrael, from his deadly quiver
        When flies that shaft, and fly it must,
      That parts all else, shall doom for ever
        Our hearts to undivided dust!"

                    XII.

    He lived--he breathed--he moved--he felt;
    He raised the maid from where she knelt;
    His trance was gone, his keen eye shone
    With thoughts that long in darkness dwelt;                          
    With thoughts that burn--in rays that melt.
    As the stream late concealed
      By the fringe of its willows,
    When it rushes reveal'd
      In the light of its billows;
    As the bolt bursts on high
      From the black cloud that bound it,
    Flashed the soul of that eye
      Through the long lashes round it.
    A war-horse at the trumpet's sound,                                 
    A lion roused by heedless hound,
    A tyrant waked to sudden strife
    By graze of ill-directed knife,
    Starts not to more convulsive life
    Than he, who heard that vow, displayed,
    And all, before repressed, betrayed:
    "Now thou art mine, for ever mine,
    With life to keep, and scarce with life resign;
    Now thou art mine, that sacred oath,
    Though sworn by one, hath bound us both.                            
    Yes, fondly, wisely hast thou done;
    That vow hath saved more heads than one:
    But blench not thou--thy simplest tress
    Claims more from me than tenderness;
    I would not wrong the slenderest hair
    That clusters round thy forehead fair,
    For all the treasures buried far
    Within the caves of Istakar.
    This morning clouds upon me lowered,
    Reproaches on my head were showered,                                
    And Giaffir almost called me coward!
    Now I have motive to be brave;
    The son of his neglected slave,
    Nay, start not,'twas the term he gave,
    May show, though little apt to vaunt,
    A heart his words nor deeds can daunt.
    His son, indeed!--yet, thanks to thee,
    Perchance I am, at least shall be;
    But let our plighted secret vow
    Be only known to us as now.                                         
    I know the wretch who dares demand
    From Giaffir thy reluctant hand;
    More ill-got wealth, a meaner soul
    Holds not a Musselim's control;
    Was he not bred in Egripo?
    A viler race let Israel show!
    But let that pass--to none be told
    Our oath; the rest shall time unfold.
    To me and mine leave Osman Bey!
    I've partisans for Peril's day:                                     
    Think not I am what I appear;
    I've arms--and friends--and vengeance near."

                    XIII.

    "Think not thou art what thou appearest!
      My Selim, thou art sadly changed:
    This morn I saw thee gentlest--dearest--
      But now thou'rt from thyself estranged.
    My love thou surely knew'st before,
    It ne'er was less--nor can be more.
    To see thee--hear thee--near thee stay--
      And hate the night--I know not why,                               
    Save that we meet not but by day;
      With thee to live, with thee to die,
      I dare not to my hope deny:
    Thy cheek--thine eyes--thy lips to kiss--
    Like this--and this--no more than this;
    For, Allah! sure thy lips are flame:
      What fever in thy veins is flushing?
    My own have nearly caught the same,
      At least I feel my cheek, too, blushing.
    To soothe thy sickness, watch thy health,                           
    Partake, but never waste thy wealth,
    Or stand with smiles unmurmuring by,
    And lighten half thy poverty;
    Do all but close thy dying eye,
    For that I could not live to try;
    To these alone my thoughts aspire:
    More can I do? or thou require?
    But, Selim, thou must answer why
    We need so much of mystery?
    The cause I cannot dream nor tell,                                  
    But be it, since thou say'st 'tis well;
    Yet what thou mean'st by 'arms' and 'friends,'
    Beyond my weaker sense extends.
    I meant that Giaffir should have heard
      The very vow I plighted thee;
    His wrath would not revoke my word:
      But surely he would leave me free.
      Can this fond wish seem strange in me,
    To be what I have ever been?
    What other hath Zuleika seen                                        
    From simple childhood's earliest hour?
      What other can she seek to see
    Than thee, companion of her bower,
      The partner of her infancy?
    These cherished thoughts with life begun,
      Say, why must I no more avow?
    What change is wrought to make me shun
      The truth--my pride, and thine till now?
    To meet the gaze of stranger's eyes
    Our law--our creed--our God denies;                                 
    Nor shall one wandering thought of mine
    At such, our Prophet's will, repine:
    No! happier made by that decree,
    He left me all in leaving thee.
    Deep were my anguish, thus compelled
    To wed with one I ne'er beheld:
    This wherefore should I not reveal?
    Why wilt thou urge me to conceal?
    I know the Pacha's haughty mood
    To thee hath never boded good;                                      
    And he so often storms at nought,
    Allah! forbid that e'er he ought!
    And why I know not, but within
    My heart concealment weighs like sin.
    If then such secrecy be crime,
      And such it feels while lurking here;
    Oh, Selim! tell me yet in time,
      Nor leave me thus to thoughts of fear.
    Ah! yonder see the Tchocadar,
    My father leaves the mimic war;                                     
    I tremble now to meet his eye--
    Say, Selim, canst thou tell me why?"

                    XIV.

    "Zuleika--to thy tower's retreat
    Betake thee--Giaffir I can greet:
    And now with him I fain must prate
    Of firmans, imposts, levies, state.
    There's fearful news from Danube's banks,
    Our Vizier nobly thins his ranks
    For which the Giaour may give him thanks!
    Our Sultan hath a shorter way                                       
    Such costly triumph to repay.
    But, mark me, when the twilight drum
      Hath warned the troops to food and sleep,
    Unto thy cell with Selim come;
      Then softly from the Haram creep
      Where we may wander by the deep:
      Our garden battlements are steep;
    Nor these will rash intruder climb
    To list our words, or stint our time;
    And if he doth, I want not steel                                    
    Which some have felt, and more may feel.
    Then shalt thou learn of Selim more
    Than thou hast heard or thought before:
    Trust me, Zuleika--fear not me!
    Thou know'st I hold a Haram key."

    "Fear thee, my Selim! ne'er till now
    Did words like this----"

                            "Delay not thou;
    I keep the key--and Haroun's guard
    Have some, and hope of more reward.
    To-night, Zuleika, thou shalt hear                                  
    My tale, my purpose, and my fear:
    I am not, love! what I appear."



                   CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    The winds are high on Helle's wave,
      As on that night of stormy water
    When Love, who sent, forgot to save
    The young--the beautiful--the brave--
      The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.
    Oh! when alone along the sky
    Her turret-torch was blazing high,
    Though rising gale, and breaking foam,                              
    And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
    And clouds aloft and tides below,
    With signs and sounds, forbade to go,
    He could not see, he would not hear,
    Or sound or sign foreboding fear;
    His eye but saw that light of Love,
    The only star it hailed above;
    His ear but rang with Hero's song,
    "Ye waves, divide not lovers long!"--
    That tale is old, but Love anew                                
    May nerve young hearts to prove as true.

                    II.

    The winds are high and Helle's tide
      Rolls darkly heaving to the main;
    And Night's descending shadows hide
      That field with blood bedewed in vain,
    The desert of old Priam's pride;
      The tombs, sole relics of his reign,
    All--save immortal dreams that could beguile
    The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle!

                    III.

    Oh! yet--for there my steps have been;                              
      These feet have pressed the sacred shore,
    These limbs that buoyant wave hath borne--
    Minstrel! with thee to muse, to mourn,
      To trace again those fields of yore,
    Believing every hillock green
      Contains no fabled hero's ashes,
    And that around the undoubted scene
      Thine own "broad Hellespont" still dashes,
    Be long my lot! and cold were he
    Who there could gaze denying thee!                                  

                    IV.

    The Night hath closed on Helle's stream,
      Nor yet hath risen on Ida's hill
    That Moon, which shone on his high theme:
    No warrior chides her peaceful beam,
      But conscious shepherds bless it still.
    Their flocks are grazing on the Mound
      Of him who felt the Dardan's arrow:
    That mighty heap of gathered ground
    Which Ammon's son ran proudly round,
    By nations raised, by monarchs crowned,                             
      Is now a lone and nameless barrow!
    Within--thy dwelling-place how narrow!
    Without--can only strangers breathe
    The name of him that was beneath:
    Dust long outlasts the storied stone;
    But Thou--thy very dust is gone!

                    V.

    Late, late to-night will Dian cheer
    The swain, and chase the boatman's fear;
    Till then--no beacon on the cliff
    May shape the course of struggling skiff;                           
    The scattered lights that skirt the bay,
    All, one by one, have died away;
    The only lamp of this lone hour
    Is glimmering in Zuleika's tower.
    Yes! there is light in that lone chamber,
      And o'er her silken ottoman
    Are thrown the fragrant beads of amber,
      O'er which her fairy fingers ran;
    Near these, with emerald rays beset,
    (How could she thus that gem forget?)                               
    Her mother's sainted amulet,
    Whereon engraved the Koorsee text,
    Could smooth this life, and win the next;
    And by her Comboloio lies
    A Koran of illumined dyes;
    And many a bright emblazoned rhyme
    By Persian scribes redeemed from Time;
    And o'er those scrolls, not oft so mute,
    Reclines her now neglected lute;
    And round her lamp of fretted gold                                  
    Bloom flowers in urns of China's mould;
    The richest work of Iran's loom,
    And Sheeraz tribute of perfume;

    All that can eye or sense delight
      Are gathered in that gorgeous room:
      But yet it hath an air of gloom.
    She, of this Peri cell the sprite,
    What doth she hence, and on so rude a night?

                    VI.

    Wrapt in the darkest sable vest,
      Which none save noblest Moslem wear,                              
    To guard from winds of Heaven the breast
      As Heaven itself to Selim dear,
    With cautious steps the thicket threading,
      And starting oft, as through the glade
      The gust its hollow moanings made,
    Till on the smoother pathway treading,
    More free her timid bosom beat,
      The maid pursued her silent guide;
    And though her terror urged retreat,
      How could she quit her Selim's side?                              
      How teach her tender lips to chide?

                    VII.

    They reached at length a grotto, hewn
      By nature, but enlarged by art,
    Where oft her lute she wont to tune,
      And oft her Koran conned apart;
    And oft in youthful reverie
    She dreamed what Paradise might be:
    Where Woman's parted soul shall go
    Her Prophet had disdained to show;
    But Selim's mansion was secure,                                     
    Nor deemed she, could he long endure
    His bower in other worlds of bliss
    Without her, most beloved in this!
    Oh! who so dear with him could dwell?
    What Houri soothe him half so well?

                    VIII.

    Since last she visited the spot
    Some change seemed wrought within the grot:
    It might be only that the night
    Disguised things seen by better light:
    That brazen lamp but dimly threw                                    
    A ray of no celestial hue;
    But in a nook within the cell
    Her eye on stranger objects fell.
    There arms were piled, not such as wield
    The turbaned Delis in the field;
    But brands of foreign blade and hilt,
    And one was red--perchance with guilt!
    Ah! how without can blood be spilt?
    A cup too on the board was set
    That did not seem to hold sherbet.                                  
    What may this mean? she turned to see
    Her Selim--"Oh! can this be he?"

                    IX.

    His robe of pride was thrown aside,
      His brow no high-crowned turban bore,
    But in its stead a shawl of red,
      Wreathed lightly round, his temples wore:
    That dagger, on whose hilt the gem
    Were worthy of a diadem,
    No longer glittered at his waist,
    Where pistols unadorned were braced;                                
    And from his belt a sabre swung,
    And from his shoulder loosely hung
    The cloak of white, the thin capote
    That decks the wandering Candiote;
    Beneath--his golden plated vest
    Clung like a cuirass to his breast;
    The greaves below his knee that wound
    With silvery scales were sheathed and bound.
    But were it not that high command
    Spake in his eye, and tone, and hand,                               
    All that a careless eye could see
    In him was some young Galiong?e.

                    X.

    "I said I was not what I seemed;
      And now thou see'st my words were true:
    I have a tale thou hast not dreamed,
      If sooth--its truth must others rue.
    My story now 'twere vain to hide,
    I must not see thee Osman's bride:
    But had not thine own lips declared
    How much of that young heart I shared,                              
    I could not, must not, yet have shown
    The darker secret of my own.
    In this I speak not now of love;
    That--let Time--Truth--and Peril prove:
    But first--Oh! never wed another--
    Zuleika! I am not thy brother!"

                    XI.

    "Oh! not my brother!--yet unsay--
      God! am I left alone on earth
    To mourn--I dare not curse--the day
      That saw my solitary birth?                                       
    Oh! thou wilt love me now no more!
      My sinking heart foreboded ill;
    But know me all I was before,
      Thy sister--friend--Zuleika still.
    Thou led'st me here perchance to kill;
      If thou hast cause for vengeance, see!
    My breast is offered--take thy fill!
      Far better with the dead to be
      Than live thus nothing now to thee:
    Perhaps far worse, for now I know                                   
    Why Giaffir always seemed thy foe;
    And I, alas! am Giaffir's child,
    For whom thou wert contemned, reviled.
    If not thy sister--would'st thou save
    My life--Oh! bid me be thy slave!"

                    XII.

    "My slave, Zuleika!--nay, I'm thine:
      But, gentle love, this transport calm,
    Thy lot shall yet be linked with mine;
    I swear it by our Prophet's shrine,
      And be that thought thy sorrow's balm.                            
    So may the Koran verse displayed
    Upon its steel direct my blade,
    In danger's hour to guard us both,
    As I preserve that awful oath!
    The name in which thy heart hath prided
      Must change; but, my Zuleika, know,
    That tie is widened, not divided,
      Although thy Sire's my deadliest foe.
    My father was to Giaffir all
      That Selim late was deemed to thee;                               
    That brother wrought a brother's fall,
      But spared, at least, my infancy!
    And lulled me with a vain deceit
    That yet a like return may meet.
    He reared me, not with tender help,
      But like the nephew of a Cain;
    He watched me like a lion's whelp,
      That gnaws and yet may break his chain.
      My father's blood in every vein
    Is boiling! but for thy dear sake                                   
    No present vengeance will I take;
      Though here I must no more remain.
    But first, beloved Zuleika! hear
    How Giaffir wrought this deed of fear.

                    XIII.

    "How first their strife to rancour grew,
      If Love or Envy made them foes,
    It matters little if I knew;
    In fiery spirits, slights, though few
      And thoughtless, will disturb repose.
    In war Abdallah's arm was strong,                                   
      Remembered yet in Bosniac song,
    And Paswan's rebel hordes attest
    How little love they bore such guest:
    His death is all I need relate,
    The stern effect of Giaffir's hate;
    And how my birth disclosed to me,
    Whate'er beside it makes, hath made me free.

                    XIV.

    "When Paswan, after years of strife,
    At last for power, but first for life,
    In Widdin's walls too proudly sate,                                 
    Our Pachas rallied round the state;
    Not last nor least in high command,
    Each brother led a separate band;
    They gave their Horse-tails to the wind,
      And mustering in Sophia's plain
    Their tents were pitched, their post assigned;
      To one, alas! assigned in vain!
    What need of words? the deadly bowl,
      By Giaffir's order drugged and given,
    With venom subtle as his soul,
      Dismissed Abdallah's hence to heaven.                             
    Reclined and feverish in the bath,
    He, when the hunter's sport was up,
    But little deemed a brother's wrath
      To quench his thirst had such a cup:
    The bowl a bribed attendant bore;
    He drank one draught, nor needed more!
    If thou my tale, Zuleika, doubt,
    Call Haroun--he can tell it out.

                    XV.

    "The deed once done, and Paswan's feud                              
    In part suppressed, though ne'er subdued,
      Abdallah's Pachalick was gained:--
    Thou know'st not what in our Divan
    Can wealth procure for worse than man--
      Abdallah's honours were obtained
    By him a brother's murder stained;
    'Tis true, the purchase nearly drained
    His ill-got treasure, soon replaced.
    Would'st question whence? Survey the waste,
    And ask the squalid peasant how                                     
    His gains repay his broiling brow!--
    Why me the stern Usurper spared,
    Why thus with me his palace spared,
    I know not. Shame--regret--remorse--
    And little fear from infant's force--
    Besides, adoption as a son
    By him whom Heaven accorded none,
    Or some unknown cabal, caprice,
    Preserved me thus:--but not in peace:
    He cannot curb his haughty mood,                                
    Nor I forgive a father's blood.

                    XVI.

    "Within thy Father's house are foes;
      Not all who break his bread are true:
    To these should I my birth disclose,
      His days-his very hours were few:
    They only want a heart to lead,
    A hand to point them to the deed.
    But Haroun only knows, or knew
      This tale, whose close is almost nigh:
    He in Abdallah's palace grew,                                       
      And held that post in his Serai
      Which holds he here--he saw him die;
    But what could single slavery do?
    Avenge his lord? alas! too late;
    Or save his son from such a fate?
    He chose the last, and when elate
      With foes subdued, or friends betrayed,
    Proud Giaffir in high triumph sate,
    He led me helpless to his gate,
      And not in vain it seems essayed                                  
      To save the life for which he prayed.
    The knowledge of my birth secured
      From all and each, but most from me;
    Thus Giaffir's safety was ensured.
      Removed he too from Roumelie
    To this our Asiatic side,
    Far from our seats by Danube's tide,
      With none but Haroun, who retains
    Such knowledge--and that Nubian feels
      A Tyrant's secrets are but chains,                                
    From which the captive gladly steals,
    And this and more to me reveals:
    Such still to guilt just Allah sends--
    Slaves, tools, accomplices--no friends!

                    XVII.

    "All this, Zuleika, harshly sounds;
      But harsher still my tale must be:
    Howe'er my tongue thy softness wounds,
      Yet I must prove all truth to thee."
      I saw thee start this garb to see,
    Yet is it one I oft have worn,                                      
      And long must wear: this Galiong?e,
    To whom thy plighted vow is sworn,
      Is leader of those pirate hordes,
      Whose laws and lives are on their swords;
    To hear whose desolating tale
    Would make thy waning cheek more pale:
    Those arms thou see'st my band have brought,
    The hands that wield are not remote;
    This cup too for the rugged knaves
      Is filled--once quaffed, they ne'er repine:                       
    Our Prophet might forgive the slaves;
      They're only infidels in wine.

                    XVIII.

    "What could I be? Proscribed at home,
    And taunted to a wish to roam;
    And listless left--for Giaffir's fear
    Denied the courser and the spear--
    Though oft--Oh, Mahomet! how oft!--
    In full Divan the despot scoffed,
    As if my weak unwilling hand
    Refused the bridle or the brand:                                    
    He ever went to war alone,
    And pent me here untried--unknown;
    To Haroun's care with women left,
    By hope unblest, of fame bereft,
    While thou--whose softness long endeared,
    Though it unmanned me, still had cheered--
    To Brusa's walls for safety sent,
    Awaited'st there the field's event.
    Haroun who saw my spirit pining
      Beneath inaction's sluggish yoke,                                 
    His captive, though with dread resigning,
      My thraldom for a season broke,
    On promise to return before
    The day when Giaffir's charge was o'er.
    'Tis vain--my tongue can not impart
    My almost drunkenness of heart,
    When first this liberated eye
    Surveyed Earth--Ocean--Sun--and Sky--
    As if my Spirit pierced them through,
    And all their inmost wonders knew!                                  
    One word alone can paint to thee
    That more than feeling--I was Free!
    E'en for thy presence ceased to pine;
    The World--nay, Heaven itself was mine!

                    XIX.

    "The shallop of a trusty Moor
    Conveyed me from this idle shore;
    I longed to see the isles that gem
    Old Ocean's purple diadem:
    I sought by turns, and saw them all;
      But when and where I joined the crew,                             
    With whom I'm pledged to rise or fall,
      When all that we design to do
    Is done,'twill then be time more meet
    To tell thee, when the tale's complete.

                    XX.

    "'Tis true, they are a lawless brood,
    But rough in form, nor mild in mood;
    And every creed, and every race,
    With them hath found--may find a place:
    But open speech, and ready hand,
    Obedience to their Chief's command;                                 
    A soul for every enterprise,
    That never sees with Terror's eyes;
    Friendship for each, and faith to all,
    And vengeance vowed for those who fall,
    Have made them fitting instruments
    For more than e'en my own intents.
    And some--and I have studied all
      Distinguished from the vulgar rank,
    But chiefly to my council call
      The wisdom of the cautious Frank:--                               
    And some to higher thoughts aspire.
      The last of Lambro's patriots there
      Anticipated freedom share;
    And oft around the cavern fire
    On visionary schemes debate,
    To snatch the Rayahs from their fate.
    So let them ease their hearts with prate
    Of equal rights, which man ne'er knew;
    I have a love for freedom too.
    Aye! let me like the ocean-Patriarch roam,                     
    Or only know on land the Tartar's home!
    My tent on shore, my galley on the sea,
    Are more than cities and Serais to me:
    Borne by my steed, or wafted by my sail,
    Across the desert, or before the gale,
    Bound where thou wilt, my barb! or glide, my prow!
    But be the Star that guides the wanderer, Thou!
    Thou, my Zuleika, share and bless my bark;
    The Dove of peace and promise to mine ark!
    Or, since that hope denied in worlds of strife,                     
    Be thou the rainbow to the storms of life!
    The evening beam that smiles the clouds away,
    And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray!
    Blest--as the Muezzin's strain from Mecca's wall
    To pilgrims pure and prostrate at his call;
    Soft--as the melody of youthful days,
    That steals the trembling tear of speechless praise;
    Dear--as his native song to Exile's ears,
    Shall sound each tone thy long-loved voice endears.
    For thee in those bright isles is built a bower                     
    Blooming as Aden in its earliest hour.
    A thousand swords, with Selim's heart and hand,
    Wait--wave--defend--destroy--at thy command!
    Girt by my band, Zuleika at my side,
    The spoil of nations shall bedeck my bride.
    The Haram's languid years of listless ease
    Are well resigned for cares--for joys like these:
    Not blind to Fate, I see, where'er I rove,
    Unnumbered perils,--but one only love!
    Yet well my toils shall that fond breast repay,                     
    Though Fortune frown, or falser friends betray.
    How dear the dream in darkest hours of ill,
    Should all be changed, to find thee faithful still!
    Be but thy soul, like Selim's firmly shown;
    To thee be Selim's tender as thine own;
    To soothe each sorrow, share in each delight,
    Blend every thought, do all--but disunite!
    Once free, 'tis mine our horde again to guide;
    Friends to each other, foes to aught beside:
    Yet there we follow but the bent assigned                           
    By fatal Nature to man's warring kind:
    Mark! where his carnage and his conquests cease!
    He makes a solitude, and calls it--peace!
    I like the rest must use my skill or strength,
    But ask no land beyond my sabre's length:
    Power sways but by division--her resource
    The blest alternative of fraud or force!
    Ours be the last; in time Deceit may come
    When cities cage us in a social home:
    There ev'n thy soul might err--how oft the heart                    
    Corruption shakes which Peril could not part!
    And Woman, more than Man, when Death or Woe,
    Or even Disgrace, would lay her lover low,
    Sunk in the lap of Luxury will shame--
    Away suspicion!--not Zuleika's name!
    But life is hazard at the best; and here
    No more remains to win, and much to fear:
    Yes, fear!--the doubt, the dread of losing thee,
    By Osman's power, and Giaffir's stern decree.
    That dread shall vanish with the favouring gale,                    
    Which Love to-night hath promised to my sail:
    No danger daunts the pair his smile hath blest,
    Their steps still roving, but their hearts at rest.
    With thee all toils are sweet, each clime hath charms;
    Earth--sea alike--our world within our arms!
    Aye--let the loud winds whistle o'er the deck,
    So that those arms cling closer round my neck:
    The deepest murmur of this lip shall be,
    No sigh for safety, but a prayer for thee!
    The war of elements no fears impart                                 
    To Love, whose deadliest bane is human Art:
    There lie the only rocks our course can check;
    Here moments menace--there are years of wreck!
    But hence ye thoughts that rise in Horror's shape!
    This hour bestows, or ever bars escape.
    Few words remain of mine my tale to close;
    Of thine but one to waft us from our foes;
    Yea--foes--to me will Giaffir's hate decline?
    And is not Osman, who would part us, thine?

                    XXI.

    "His head and faith from doubt and death                            
      Returned in time my guard to save;
      Few heard, none told, that o'er the wave
    From isle to isle I roved the while:
    And since, though parted from my band
    Too seldom now I leave the land,
    No deed they've done, nor deed shall do,
    Ere I have heard and doomed it too:
    I form the plan--decree the spoil--
    Tis fit I oftener share the toil.
    But now too long I've held thine ear;                               
    Time presses--floats my bark--and here
    We leave behind but hate and fear.
    To-morrow Osman with his train
    Arrives--to-night must break thy chain:
    And would'st thou save that haughty Bey,--
      Perchance his life who gave thee thine,--
    With me this hour away--away!
      But yet, though thou art plighted mine,
    Would'st thou recall thy willing vow,
    Appalled by truths imparted now,                                    
    Here rest I--not to see thee wed:
    But be that peril on my head!"

                    XXII.

    Zuleika, mute and motionless,
    Stood like that Statue of Distress,
    When, her last hope for ever gone,
    The Mother hardened into stone;
    All in the maid that eye could see
    Was but a younger Niob?.
    But ere her lip, or even her eye,
    Essayed to speak, or look reply,                                    
    Beneath the garden's wicket porch
    Far flashed on high a blazing torch!
    Another--and another--and another--
    "Oh! fly--no more--yet now my more than brother!"
    Far, wide, through every thicket spread
    The fearful lights are gleaming red;
    Nor these alone--for each right hand
    Is ready with a sheathless brand.
    They part--pursue--return, and wheel
    With searching flambeau, shining steel;                             
    And last of all, his sabre waving,
    Stern Giaffir in his fury raving:
    And now almost they touch the cave--
    Oh! must that grot be Selim's grave?

                    XXIII.

    Dauntless he stood--"'Tis come--soon past--
    One kiss, Zuleika--'tis my last:
      But yet my band not far from shore
    May hear this signal, see the flash;
    Yet now too few--the attempt were rash:
      No matter--yet one effort more."                                 
    Forth to the cavern mouth he stept;
      His pistol's echo rang on high,
    Zuleika started not, nor wept,
      Despair benumbed her breast and eye!--
    "They hear me not, or if they ply
    Their oars,'tis but to see me die;
    That sound hath drawn my foes more nigh.
    Then forth my father's scimitar,
    Thou ne'er hast seen less equal war!
    Farewell, Zuleika!--Sweet! retire:                                 
      Yet stay within--here linger safe,
      At thee his rage will only chafe.
    Stir not--lest even to thee perchance
    Some erring blade or ball should glance.
    Fear'st them for him?--may I expire
    If in this strife I seek thy sire!
    No--though by him that poison poured;
    No--though again he call me coward!
    But tamely shall I meet their steel?
    No--as each crest save his may feel!"                            

                    XXIV.

    One bound he made, and gained the sand:
      Already at his feet hath sunk
    The foremost of the prying band,
      A gasping head, a quivering trunk:
    Another falls--but round him close
    A swarming circle of his foes;
    From right to left his path he cleft,
      And almost met the meeting wave:
    His boat appears--not five oars' length--
    His comrades strain with desperate strength--                      
      Oh! are they yet in time to save?
      His feet the foremost breakers lave;
    His band are plunging in the bay,
    Their sabres glitter through the spray;
    Wet--wild--unwearied to the strand
    They struggle--now they touch the land!
    They come--'tis but to add to slaughter--
    His heart's best blood is on the water.

                    XXV.

    Escaped from shot, unharmed by steel,
    Or scarcely grazed its force to feel,                          
    Had Selim won, betrayed, beset,
    To where the strand and billows met;
    There as his last step left the land,
    And the last death-blow dealt his hand--
    Ah! wherefore did he turn to look
      For her his eye but sought in vain?
    That pause, that fatal gaze he took,
      Hath doomed his death, or fixed his chain.
    Sad proof, in peril and in pain,
    How late will Lover's hope remain!                                 
    His back was to the dashing spray;
    Behind, but close, his comrades lay,
    When, at the instant, hissed the ball--
    "So may the foes of Giaffir fall!"
    Whose voice is heard? whose carbine rang?
    Whose bullet through the night-air sang,
    Too nearly, deadly aimed to err?
    'Tis thine--Abdallah's Murderer!
    The father slowly rued thy hate,
    The son hath found a quicker fate:                                 
    Fast from his breast the blood is bubbling,
    The whiteness of the sea-foam troubling--
    If aught his lips essayed to groan,
    The rushing billows choked the tone!

                    XXVI.

    Morn slowly rolls the clouds away;
      Few trophies of the fight are there:
    The shouts that shook the midnight-bay
    Are silent; but some signs of fray
      That strand of strife may bear,
    And fragments of each shivered brand;                              
    Steps stamped; and dashed into the sand
    The print of many a struggling hand
      May there be marked; nor far remote
      A broken torch, an oarless boat;
    And tangled on the weeds that heap
    The beach where shelving to the deep
      There lies a white capote!
    'Tis rent in twain--one dark-red stain
    The wave yet ripples o'er in vain:
      But where is he who wore?                                        
    Ye! who would o'er his relics weep,
    Go, seek them where the surges sweep
    Their burthen round Sig?um's steep
      And cast on Lemnos' shore:
    The sea-birds shriek above the prey,
    O'er which their hungry beaks delay,
    As shaken on his restless pillow,
    His head heaves with the heaving billow;
    That hand, whose motion is not life,
    Yet feebly seems to menace strife,                                 
    Flung by the tossing tide on high,
      Then levelled with the wave--
    What recks it, though that corse shall lie
      Within a living grave?
    The bird that tears that prostrate form
    Hath only robbed the meaner worm;
    The only heart, the only eye
    Had bled or wept to see him die,
    Had seen those scattered limbs composed,
      And mourned above his turban-stone,                         
    That heart hath burst--that eye was closed--
      Yea--closed before his own!

                    XXVII.

    By Helle's stream there is a voice of wail!
    And Woman's eye is wet--Man's cheek is pale:
    Zuleika! last of Giaffir's race,
      Thy destined lord is come too late:
    He sees not--ne'er shall see thy face!
          Can he not hear
    The loud Wul-wulleh warn his distant ear?
      Thy handmaids weeping at the gate,                               
      The Koran-chanters of the Hymn of Fate,
      The silent slaves with folded arms that wait,
    Sighs in the hall, and shrieks upon the gale,
          Tell him thy tale!
    Thou didst not view thy Selim fall!
      That fearful moment when he left the cave
          Thy heart grew chill:
      He was thy hope--thy joy--thy love--thine all,
      And that last thought on him thou could'st not save
            Sufficed to kill;                                          
    Burst forth in one wild cry--and all was still.
      Peace to thy broken heart--and virgin grave!
    Ah! happy! but of life to lose the worst!
    That grief--though deep--though fatal--was thy first!
    Thrice happy! ne'er to feel nor fear the force
    Of absence--shame--pride--hate--revenge--remorse!
    And, oh! that pang where more than Madness lies
    The Worm that will not sleep--and never dies;
    Thought of the gloomy day and ghastly night,
    That dreads the darkness, and yet loathes the light,               
    That winds around, and tears the quivering heart!
    Ah! wherefore not consume it--and depart!
    Woe to thee, rash and unrelenting Chief!
      Vainly thou heap'st the dust upon thy head,
      Vainly the sackcloth o'er thy limbs dost spread:
      By that same hand Abdallah--Selim bled.
    Now let it tear thy beard in idle grief:
    Thy pride of heart, thy bride for Osman's bed,
    She, whom thy Sultan had but seen to wed,
          Thy Daughter's dead!                                         
      Hope of thine age, thy twilight's lonely beam,
      The Star hath set that shone on Helle's stream.
    What quenched its ray?--the blood that thou hast shed!
    Hark! to the hurried question of Despair:
    "Where is my child?"--an Echo answers--"Where?"

                    XXVIII.

    Within the place of thousand tombs
      That shine beneath, while dark above
    The sad but living cypress glooms
      And withers not, though branch and leaf
    Are stamped with an eternal grief,                                 
      Like early unrequited Love,
    One spot exists, which ever blooms,
      Ev'n in that deadly grove--
    A single rose is shedding there
      Its lonely lustre, meek and pale:
    It looks as planted by Despair--
      So white--so faint--the slightest gale
    Might whirl the leaves on high;
      And yet, though storms and blight assail,
    And hands more rude than wintry sky                                
      May wring it from the stem--in vain--
      To-morrow sees it bloom again!
    The stalk some Spirit gently rears,
    And waters with celestial tears;
      For well may maids of Helle deem
    That this can be no earthly flower,
    Which mocks the tempest's withering hour,
    And buds unsheltered by a bower;
    Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,
      Nor woos the Summer beam:                                        
    To it the livelong night there sings
      A Bird unseen--but not remote:
    Invisible his airy wings,
    But soft as harp that Houri strings
      His long entrancing note!
    It were the Bulbul; but his throat,
      Though mournful, pours not such a strain:
    For they who listen cannot leave
    The spot, but linger there and grieve,
      As if they loved in vain!                                        
    And yet so sweet the tears they shed,
    'Tis sorrow so unmixed with dread,
    They scarce can bear the morn to break
      That melancholy spell,
    And longer yet would weep and wake,
      He sings so wild and well!
    But when the day-blush bursts from high
      Expires that magic melody.
    And some have been who could believe,
    (So fondly youthful dreams deceive,                                
      Yet harsh be they that blame,)
    That note so piercing and profound
    Will shape and syllable its sound
      Into Zuleika's name.
    'Tis from her cypress summit heard,
    That melts in air the liquid word:
    'Tis from her lowly virgin earth
    That white rose takes its tender birth.
    There late was laid a marble stone;
    Eve saw it placed--the Morrow gone!                                
    It was no mortal arm that bore
    That deep fixed pillar to the shore;
    For there, as Helle's legends tell,
    Next morn 'twas found where Selim fell;
    Lashed by the tumbling tide, whose wave
    Denied his bones a holier grave:
    And there by night, reclined, 'tis said.
    Is seen a ghastly turbaned head:
      And hence extended by the billow,
      'Tis named the "Pirate-phantom's pillow!"                        
      Where first it lay that mourning flower
      Hath flourished; flourisheth this hour,
    Alone and dewy--coldly pure and pale;
    As weeping Beauty's cheek at Sorrow's tale!




                            THE CORSAIR.



                      CANTO THE FIRST.

    "----nessun maggior dolore,
    Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
    Nella miseria,----"
                                                 Dante, Inferno, v. 121.

                    I.

    "O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,
    Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,
    Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,
    Survey our empire, and behold our home!
    These are our realms, no limits to their sway--
    Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.
    Ours the wild life in tumult still to range
    From toil to rest, and joy in every change.
    Oh, who can tell? not thou, luxurious slave!
    Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave;                       
    Not thou, vain lord of Wantonness and Ease!
    Whom Slumber soothes not--Pleasure cannot please--
    Oh, who can tell, save he whose heart hath tried,
    And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide,
    The exulting sense--the pulse's maddening play,
    That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way?
    That for itself can woo the approaching fight,
    And turn what some deem danger to delight;
    That seeks what cravens shun with more than zeal,
    And where the feebler faint can only feel--                          
    Feel--to the rising bosom's inmost core,
    Its hope awaken and its spirit soar?
    No dread of Death--if with us die our foes--
    Save that it seems even duller than repose;
    Come when it will--we snatch the life of Life--
    When lost--what recks it by disease or strife?
    Let him who crawls, enamoured of decay,
    Cling to his couch, and sicken years away;
    Heave his thick breath, and shake his palsied head;
    Ours the fresh turf, and not the feverish bed,--                     
    While gasp by gasp he falters forth his soul,
    Ours with one pang--one bound--escapes control.
    His corse may boast its urn and narrow cave,
    And they who loathed his life may gild his grave:
    Ours are the tears, though few, sincerely shed,
    When Ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead.
    For us, even banquets fond regret supply
    In the red cup that crowns our memory;
    And the brief epitaph in Danger's day,
    When those who win at length divide the prey,                        
    And cry, Remembrance saddening o'er each brow,
    How had the brave who fell exulted now!"

                    II.

    Such were the notes that from the Pirate's isle
    Around the kindling watch-fire rang the while:
    Such were the sounds that thrilled the rocks along,
    And unto ears as rugged seemed a song!
    In scattered groups upon the golden sand,
    They game--carouse--converse--or whet the brand;
    Select the arms--to each his blade assign,
    And careless eye the blood that dims its shine;                      
    Repair the boat, replace the helm or oar,
    While others straggling muse along the shore;
    For the wild bird the busy springes set,
    Or spread beneath the sun the dripping net:
    Gaze where some distant sail a speck supplies,
    With all the thirsting eye of Enterprise;
    Tell o'er the tales of many a night of toil,
    And marvel where they next shall seize a spoil:
    No matter where--their chief's allotment this;
    Theirs to believe no prey nor plan amiss.                            
    But who that Chief? his name on every shore
    Is famed and feared--they ask and know no more
    With these he mingles not but to command;
    Few are his words, but keen his eye and hand.
    Ne'er seasons he with mirth their jovial mess,
    But they forgive his silence for success.
    Ne'er for his lip the purpling cup they fill,
    That goblet passes him untasted still--
    And for his fare--the rudest of his crew
    Would that, in turn, have passed untasted too;                       
    Earth's coarsest bread, the garden's homeliest roots,
    And scarce the summer luxury of fruits,
    His short repast in humbleness supply
    With all a hermit's board would scarce deny.
    But while he shuns the grosser joys of sense,
    His mind seems nourished by that abstinence.
    "Steer to that shore!"--they sail. "Do this!"--'tis done:
    "Now form and follow me!"--the spoil is won.
    Thus prompt his accents and his actions still,
    And all obey and few inquire his will;                               
    To such, brief answer and contemptuous eye
    Convey reproof, nor further deign reply.

                    III.

    "A sail!--a sail!"--a promised prize to Hope!
    Her nation--flag--how speaks the telescope?
    No prize, alas! but yet a welcome sail:
    The blood-red signal glitters in the gale.
    Yes--she is ours--a home-returning bark--
    Blow fair, thou breeze!--she anchors ere the dark.
    Already doubled is the cape--our bay
    Receives that prow which proudly spurns the spray.                   
    How gloriously her gallant course she goes!
    Her white wings flying--never from her foes--
    She walks the waters like a thing of Life!
    And seems to dare the elements to strife.
    Who would not brave the battle-fire, the wreck,
    To move the monarch of her peopled deck!

                    IV.

    Hoarse o'er her side the rustling cable rings:
    The sails are furled; and anchoring round she swings;
    And gathering loiterers on the land discern
    Her boat descending from the latticed stern.                        
    'Tis manned--the oars keep concert to the strand,
    Till grates her keel upon the shallow sand.
    Hail to the welcome shout!--the friendly speech!
    When hand grasps hand uniting on the beach;
    The smile, the question, and the quick reply,
    And the Heart's promise of festivity!

                    V.

    The tidings spread, and gathering grows the crowd:
    The hum of voices, and the laughter loud,
    And Woman's gentler anxious tone is heard--
    Friends'--husbands'--lovers' names in each dear word:               
    "Oh! are they safe? we ask not of success--
    But shall we see them? will their accents bless?
    From where the battle roars, the billows chafe,
    They doubtless boldly did--but who are safe?
    Here let them haste to gladden and surprise,
    And kiss the doubt from these delighted eyes!"

                    VI.

    "Where is our Chief? for him we bear report--
    And doubt that joy--which hails our coming--short;
    Yet thus sincere--'tis cheering, though so brief;
    But, Juan! instant guide us to our Chief:                           
    Our greeting paid, we'll feast on our return,
    And all shall hear what each may wish to learn."
    Ascending slowly by the rock-hewn way,
    To where his watch-tower beetles o'er the bay,
    By bushy brake, the wild flowers blossoming,
    And freshness breathing from each silver spring,
    Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,
    Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst;
    From crag to cliff they mount--Near yonder cave,
    What lonely straggler looks along the wave?                         
    In pensive posture leaning on the brand,
    Not oft a resting-staff to that red hand?
    "'Tis he--'tis Conrad--here--as wont--alone;
    On--Juan!--on--and make our purpose known.
    The bark he views--and tell him we would greet
    His ear with tidings he must quickly meet:
    We dare not yet approach--thou know'st his mood,
    When strange or uninvited steps intrude."

                    VII.

    Him Juan sought, and told of their intent;--
    He spake not, but a sign expressed assent,                          
    These Juan calls--they come--to their salute
    He bends him slightly, but his lips are mute.
    "These letters, Chief, are from the Greek--the spy,
    Who still proclaims our spoil or peril nigh:
    Whate'er his tidings, we can well report,
    Much that"--"Peace, peace!"--he cuts their prating short.
    Wondering they turn, abashed, while each to each
    Conjecture whispers in his muttering speech:
    They watch his glance with many a stealing look,
    To gather how that eye the tidings took;                            
    But, this as if he guessed, with head aside,
    Perchance from some emotion, doubt, or pride,
    He read the scroll--"My tablets, Juan, hark--
    Where is Gonsalvo?"

                         "In the anchored bark."
    "There let him stay--to him this order bear--
    Back to your duty--for my course prepare:
    Myself this enterprise to-night will share."
    "To-night, Lord Conrad?"
                             "Aye! at set of sun:
    The breeze will freshen when the day is done.
    My corslet--cloak--one hour and we are gone.                        
    Sling on thy bugle--see that free from rust
    My carbine-lock springs worthy of my trust;
    Be the edge sharpened of my boarding-brand,
    And give its guard more room to fit my hand.
    This let the Armourer with speed dispose;
    Last time, it more fatigued my arm than foes;
    Mark that the signal-gun be duly fired,
    To tell us when the hour of stay's expired."

                    VIII.

    They make obeisance, and retire in haste,
    Too soon to seek again the watery waste:                            
    Yet they repine not--so that Conrad guides;
    And who dare question aught that he decides?
    That man of loneliness and mystery,
    Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;
    Whose name appals the fiercest of his crew,
    And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;
    Still sways their souls with that commanding art
    That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.
    What is that spell, that thus his lawless train
    Confess and envy--yet oppose in vain?                               
    What should it be, that thus their faith can bind?
    The power of Thought--the magic of the Mind!
    Linked with success, assumed and kept with skill,
    That moulds another's weakness to its will;
    Wields with their hands, but, still to these unknown,
    Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.
    Such hath it been--shall be--beneath the Sun
    The many still must labour for the one!
    'Tis Nature's doom--but let the wretch who toils,
    Accuse not--hate not--him who wears the spoils.                   
    Oh! if he knew the weight of splendid chains,
    How light the balance of his humbler pains!

                    IX.

    Unlike the heroes of each ancient race,
    Demons in act, but Gods at least in face,
    In Conrad's form seems little to admire,
    Though his dark eyebrow shades a glance of fire:
    Robust but not Herculean--to the sight
    No giant frame sets forth his common height;
    Yet, in the whole, who paused to look again,
    Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men;                        
    They gaze and marvel how--and still confess
    That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.
    Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale
    The sable curls in wild profusion veil;
    And oft perforce his rising lip reveals
    The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals.
    Though smooth his voice, and calm his general mien,
    Still seems there something he would not have seen:
    His features' deepening lines and varying hue
    At times attracted, yet perplexed the view,                         
    As if within that murkiness of mind
    Worked feelings fearful, and yet undefined;
    Such might it be--that none could truly tell--
    Too close inquiry his stern glance would quell.
    There breathe but few whose aspect might defy
    The full encounter of his searching eye;
    He had the skill, when Cunning's gaze would seek
    To probe his heart and watch his changing cheek,
    At once the observer's purpose to espy,
    And on himself roll back his scrutiny,                              
    Lest he to Conrad rather should betray
    Some secret thought, than drag that Chief's to day.
    There was a laughing Devil in his sneer,
    That raised emotions both of rage and fear;
    And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,
    Hope withering fled--and Mercy sighed farewell!

                    X.

    Slight are the outward signs of evil thought,
    Within--within--'twas there the spirit wrought!
    Love shows all changes--Hate, Ambition, Guile,
    Betray no further than the bitter smile;                            
    The lip's least curl, the lightest paleness thrown
    Along the governed aspect, speak alone
    Of deeper passions; and to judge their mien,
    He, who would see, must be himself unseen.
    Then--with the hurried tread, the upward eye,
    The clench?d hand, the pause of agony,
    That listens, starting, lest the step too near
    Approach intrusive on that mood of fear:
    Then--with each feature working from the heart,
    With feelings, loosed to strengthen--not depart,                    
    That rise--convulse--contend--that freeze or glow,
    Flush in the cheek, or damp upon the brow;
    Then--Stranger! if thou canst, and tremblest not,
    Behold his soul--the rest that soothes his lot!
    Mark how that lone and blighted bosom sears
    The scathing thought of execrated years!
    Behold--but who hath seen, or e'er shall see,
    Man as himself--the secret spirit free?

                    XI.

    Yet was not Conrad thus by Nature sent
    To lead the guilty--Guilt's worse instrument--                      
    His soul was changed, before his deeds had driven
    Him forth to war with Man and forfeit Heaven.
    Warped by the world in Disappointment's school,
    In words too wise--in conduct there a fool;
    Too firm to yield, and far too proud to stoop,
    Doomed by his very virtues for a dupe,
    He cursed those virtues as the cause of ill,
    And not the traitors who betrayed him still;
    Nor deemed that gifts bestowed on better men
    Had left him joy, and means to give again.                          
    Feared--shunned--belied--ere Youth had lost her force,
    He hated Man too much to feel remorse,
    And thought the voice of Wrath a sacred call,
    To pay the injuries of some on all.
    He knew himself a villain--but he deemed
    The rest no better than the thing he seemed;
    And scorned the best as hypocrites who hid
    Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
    He knew himself detested, but he knew
    The hearts that loathed him, crouched and dreaded too.              
    Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt
    From all affection and from all contempt:
    His name could sadden, and his acts surprise;
    But they that feared him dared not to despise:
    Man spurns the worm, but pauses ere he wake
    The slumbering venom of the folded snake:
    The first may turn, but not avenge the blow;
    The last expires, but leaves no living foe;
    Fast to the doomed offender's form it clings,
    And he may crush--not conquer--still it stings!                

                    XII.

    None are all evil--quickening round his heart,
    One softer feeling would not yet depart;
    Oft could he sneer at others as beguiled
    By passions worthy of a fool or child;
    Yet 'gainst that passion vainly still he strove,
    And even in him it asks the name of Love!
    Yes, it was love--unchangeable--unchanged,
    Felt but for one from whom he never ranged;
    Though fairest captives daily met his eye,
    He shunned, nor sought, but coldly passed them by;                  
    Though many a beauty drooped in prisoned bower,
    None ever soothed his most unguarded hour,
    Yes--it was Love--if thoughts of tenderness,
    Tried in temptation, strengthened by distress,
    Unmoved by absence, firm in every clime,
    And yet--Oh more than all!--untired by Time;
    Which nor defeated hope, nor baffled wile,
    Could render sullen were She near to smile,
    Nor rage could fire, nor sickness fret to vent
    On her one murmur of his discontent;                                
    Which still would meet with joy, with calmness part,
    Lest that his look of grief should reach her heart;
    Which nought removed, nor menaced to remove--
    If there be Love in mortals--this was Love!
    He was a villain--aye, reproaches shower
    On him--but not the Passion, nor its power,
    Which only proved--all other virtues gone--
    Not Guilt itself could quench this loveliest one!

                    XIII.

    He paused a moment--till his hastening men
    Passed the first winding downward to the glen.                      
    "Strange tidings!--many a peril have I passed,
    Nor know I why this next appears the last!
    Yet so my heart forebodes, but must not fear,
    Nor shall my followers find me falter here.
    'Tis rash to meet--but surer death to wait
    Till here they hunt us to undoubted fate;
    And, if my plan but hold, and Fortune smile,
    We'll furnish mourners for our funeral pile.
    Aye, let them slumber--peaceful be their dreams!
    Morn ne'er awoke them with such brilliant beams                     
    As kindle high to-night (but blow, thou breeze!)
    To warm these slow avengers of the seas.
    Now to Medora--Oh! my sinking heart,
    Long may her own be lighter than thou art!
    Yet was I brave--mean boast where all are brave!
    Ev'n insects sting for aught they seek to save.
    This common courage which with brutes we share,
    That owes its deadliest efforts to Despair,
    Small merit claims--but 'twas my nobler hope
    To teach my few with numbers still to cope;                         
    Long have I led them--not to vainly bleed:
    No medium now--we perish or succeed!
    So let it be--it irks not me to die;
    But thus to urge them whence they cannot fly.
    My lot hath long had little of my care,
    But chafes my pride thus baffled in the snare:
    Is this my skill? my craft? to set at last
    Hope, Power and Life upon a single cast?
    Oh, Fate!--accuse thy folly--not thy fate;
    She may redeem thee still--nor yet too late."     

                    XIV.

    Thus with himself communion held he, till
    He reached the summit of his tower-crowned hill:
    There at the portal paused--for wild and soft
    He heard those accents never heard too oft!
    Through the high lattice far yet sweet they rung,
    And these the notes his Bird of Beauty sung:

                    1.

    "Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,
      Lonely and lost to light for evermore,
    Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,
      Then trembles into silence as before.                             

                    2.

    "There, in its centre, a sepulchral lamp
      Burns the slow flame, eternal--but unseen;
    Which not the darkness of Despair can damp,
      Though vain its ray as it had never been.

                    3.

    "Remember me--Oh! pass not thou my grave
      Without one thought whose relics there recline:
    The only pang my bosom dare not brave
      Must be to find forgetfulness in thine.

                    4.

    "My fondest--faintest--latest accents hear--
      Grief for the dead not Virtue can reprove;                        
    Then give me all I ever asked--a tear,
      The first--last--sole reward of so much love!"

    He passed the portal, crossed the corridor,
    And reached the chamber as the strain gave o'er:
    "My own Medora! sure thy song is sad--"

    "In Conrad's absence would'st thou have it glad?
    Without thine ear to listen to my lay,
    Still must my song my thoughts, my soul betray:
    Still must each accent to my bosom suit,
    My heart unhushed--although my lips were mute!                      
    Oh! many a night on this lone couch reclined,
    My dreaming fear with storms hath winged the wind,
    And deemed the breath that faintly fanned thy sail
    The murmuring prelude of the ruder gale;
    Though soft--it seemed the low prophetic dirge,
    That mourned thee floating on the savage surge:
    Still would I rise to rouse the beacon fire,
    Lest spies less true should let the blaze expire;
    And many a restless hour outwatched each star,
    And morning came--and still thou wert afar.                         
    Oh! how the chill blast on my bosom blew,
    And day broke dreary on my troubled view,
    And still I gazed and gazed--and not a prow
    Was granted to my tears--my truth--my vow!
    At length--'twas noon--I hailed and blest the mast
    That met my sight--it neared--Alas! it passed!
    Another came--Oh God! 'twas thine at last!
    Would that those days were over! wilt thou ne'er,
    My Conrad! learn the joys of peace to share?
    Sure thou hast more than wealth, and many a home                    
    As bright as this invites us not to roam:
    Thou know'st it is not peril that I fear,
    I only tremble when thou art not here;
    Then not for mine, but that far dearer life,
    Which flies from love and languishes for strife--
    How strange that heart, to me so tender still,
    Should war with Nature and its better will!"

    "Yea, strange indeed--that heart hath long been changed;
    Worm-like 'twas trampled--adder-like avenged--
    Without one hope on earth beyond thy love,                          
    And scarce a glimpse of mercy from above.
    Yet the same feeling which thou dost condemn,
    My very love to thee is hate to them,
    So closely mingling here, that disentwined,
    I cease to love thee when I love Mankind:
    Yet dread not this--the proof of all the past
    Assures the future that my love will last;
    But--Oh, Medora! nerve thy gentler heart;
    This hour again--but not for long--we part."

    "This hour we part!--my heart foreboded this:                       
    Thus ever fade my fairy dreams of bliss.
    This hour--it cannot be--this hour away!
    Yon bark hath hardly anchored in the bay:
    Her consort still is absent, and her crew
    Have need of rest before they toil anew;
    My Love! thou mock'st my weakness; and wouldst steel
    My breast before the time when it must feel;
    But trifle now no more with my distress,
    Such mirth hath less of play than bitterness.
    Be silent, Conrad!--dearest! come and share                         
    The feast these hands delighted to prepare;
    Light toil! to cull and dress thy frugal fare!
    See, I have plucked the fruit that promised best,
    And where not sure, perplexed, but pleased, I guessed
    At such as seemed the fairest; thrice the hill
    My steps have wound to try the coolest rill;
    Yes! thy Sherbet to-night will sweetly flow,
    See how it sparkles in its vase of snow!
    The grapes' gay juice thy bosom never cheers;
    Thou more than Moslem when the cup appears:                         
    Think not I mean to chide--for I rejoice
    What others deem a penance is thy choice.
    But come, the board is spread; our silver lamp
    Is trimmed, and heeds not the Sirocco's damp:
    Then shall my handmaids while the time along,
    And join with me the dance, or wake the song;
    Or my guitar, which still thou lov'st to hear,
    Shall soothe or lull--or, should it vex thine ear,
    We'll turn the tale, by Ariosto told,
    Of fair Olympia loved and left of old.                         
    Why, thou wert worse than he who broke his vow
    To that lost damsel, should thou leave me now--
    Or even that traitor chief--I've seen thee smile,
    When the clear sky showed Ariadne's Isle,
    Which I have pointed from these cliffs the while:
    And thus half sportive--half in fear--I said,
    Lest Time should raise that doubt to more than dread,
    Thus Conrad, too, will quit me for the main:
    And he deceived me--for--he came again!"

    "Again, again--and oft again--my Love!                              
    If there be life below, and hope above,
    He will return--but now, the moments bring
    The time of parting with redoubled wing:
    The why, the where--what boots it now to tell?
    Since all must end in that wild word--Farewell!
    Yet would I fain--did time allow--disclose--
    Fear not--these are no formidable foes!
    And here shall watch a more than wonted guard,
    For sudden siege and long defence prepared:
    Nor be thou lonely, though thy Lord's away,                         
    Our matrons and thy handmaids with thee stay;
    And this thy comfort--that, when next we meet,
    Security shall make repose more sweet.
    List!--'tis the bugle!"--Juan shrilly blew--
    "One kiss--one more--another--Oh! Adieu!"
    She rose--she sprung--she clung to his embrace,
    Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face:
    He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,
    Which downcast drooped in tearless agony.
    Her long fair hair lay floating o'er his arms,                      
    In all the wildness of dishevelled charms;
    Scarce beat that bosom where his image dwelt
    So full--that feeling seem'd almost unfelt!
    Hark--peals the thunder of the signal-gun!
    It told 'twas sunset, and he cursed that sun.
    Again--again--that form he madly pressed,
    Which mutely clasped, imploringly caressed!
    And tottering to the couch his bride he bore,
    One moment gazed--as if to gaze no more;
    Felt that for him Earth held but her alone,                         
    Kissed her cold forehead--turned--is Conrad gone?

                    XV.

    "And is he gone?"--on sudden solitude
    How oft that fearful question will intrude!
    "'Twas but an instant past, and here he stood!
    And now"--without the portal's porch she rushed,
    And then at length her tears in freedom gushed;
    Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell;
    But still her lips refused to send--"Farewell!"
    For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er
    We promise--hope--believe--there breathes Despair.                  
    O'er every feature of that still, pale face,
    Had Sorrow fixed what Time can ne'er erase:
    The tender blue of that large loving eye
    Grew frozen with its gaze on vacancy,
    Till--Oh, how far!--it caught a glimpse of him,
    And then it flowed, and phrensied seemed to swim
    Through those long, dark, and glistening lashes dewed
    With drops of sadness oft to be renewed.
    "He's gone!"--against her heart that hand is driven,
    Convulsed and quick--then gently raised to Heaven:                  
    She looked and saw the heaving of the main:
    The white sail set--she dared not look again;
    But turned with sickening soul within the gate--
    "It is no dream--and I am desolate!"

                    XVI.

    From crag to crag descending, swiftly sped
    Stern Conrad down, nor once he turned his head;
    But shrunk whene'er the windings of his way
    Forced on his eye what he would not survey,
    His lone, but lovely dwelling on the steep,
    That hailed him first when homeward from the deep:                  
    And she--the dim and melancholy Star,
    Whose ray of Beauty reached him from afar,
    On her he must not gaze, he must not think--
    There he might rest--but on Destruction's brink:
    Yet once almost he stopped--and nearly gave
    His fate to chance, his projects to the wave:
    But no--it must not be--a worthy chief
    May melt, but not betray to Woman's grief.
    He sees his bark, he notes how fair the wind,
    And sternly gathers all his might of mind:                          
    Again he hurries on--and as he hears
    The clang of tumult vibrate on his ears,
    The busy sounds, the bustle of the shore,
    The shout, the signal, and the dashing oar;
    As marks his eye the seaboy on the mast,
    The anchors rise, the sails unfurling fast,
    The waving kerchiefs of the crowd that urge
    That mute Adieu to those who stem the surge;
    And more than all, his blood-red flag aloft,
    He marvelled how his heart could seem so soft.                      
    Fire in his glance, and wildness in his breast,
    He feels of all his former self possest;
    He bounds--he flies--until his footsteps reach
    The verge where ends the cliff, begins the beach,
    There checks his speed; but pauses less to breathe
    The breezy freshness of the deep beneath,
    Than there his wonted statelier step renew;
    Nor rush, disturbed by haste, to vulgar view:
    For well had Conrad learned to curb the crowd,
    By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud;                      
    His was the lofty port, the distant mien,
    That seems to shun the sight--and awes if seen:
    The solemn aspect, and the high-born eye,
    That checks low mirth, but lacks not courtesy;
    All these he wielded to command assent:
    But where he wished to win, so well unbent,
    That Kindness cancelled fear in those who heard,
    And others' gifts showed mean beside his word,
    When echoed to the heart as from his own
    His deep yet tender melody of tone:                                 
    But such was foreign to his wonted mood,
    He cared not what he softened, but subdued;
    The evil passions of his youth had made
    Him value less who loved--than what obeyed.

                    XVII.

    Around him mustering ranged his ready guard.
    Before him Juan stands--"Are all prepared?"
    "They are--nay more--embarked: the latest boat
    Waits but my chief----"
                           "My sword, and my capote."
    Soon firmly girded on, and lightly slung,
    His belt and cloak were o'er his shoulders flung:                   
    "Call Pedro here!" He comes--and Conrad bends,
    With all the courtesy he deigned his friends;
    "Receive these tablets, and peruse with care,
    Words of high trust and truth are graven there;
    Double the guard, and when Anselmo's bark
    Arrives, let him alike these orders mark:
    In three days (serve the breeze) the sun shall shine
    On our return--till then all peace be thine!"
    This said, his brother Pirate's hand he wrung,
    Then to his boat with haughty gesture sprung.                       
    Flashed the dipt oars, and sparkling with the stroke,
    Around the waves' phosphoric brightness broke;
    They gain the vessel--on the deck he stands,--
    Shrieks the shrill whistle, ply the busy hands--
    He marks how well the ship her helm obeys,
    How gallant all her crew, and deigns to praise.
    His eyes of pride to young Gonsalvo turn--
    Why doth he start, and inly seem to mourn?
    Alas! those eyes beheld his rocky tower,
    And live a moment o'er the parting hour;                            
    She--his Medora--did she mark the prow?
    Ah! never loved he half so much as now!
    But much must yet be done ere dawn of day--
    Again he mans himself and turns away;
    Down to the cabin with Gonsalvo bends,
    And there unfolds his plan--his means, and ends;
    Before them burns the lamp, and spreads the chart,
    And all that speaks and aids the naval art;
    They to the midnight watch protract debate;
    To anxious eyes what hour is ever late?                             
    Meantime, the steady breeze serenely blew,
    And fast and falcon-like the vessel flew;
    Passed the high headlands of each clustering isle,
    To gain their port--long--long ere morning smile:
    And soon the night-glass through the narrow bay
    Discovers where the Pacha's galleys lay.
    Count they each sail, and mark how there supine
    The lights in vain o'er heedless Moslem shine.
    Secure, unnoted, Conrad's prow passed by,
    And anchored where his ambush meant to lie;                         
    Screened from espial by the jutting cape,
    That rears on high its rude fantastic shape.
    Then rose his band to duty--not from sleep--
    Equipped for deeds alike on land or deep;
    While leaned their Leader o'er the fretting flood,
    And calmly talked--and yet he talked of blood!



                     CANTO THE SECOND.

              "Conosceste i dubbiosi desiri?"
                        Dante, Inferno, v, 120.

                    I.

    In Coron's bay floats many a galley light,
    Through Coron's lattices the lamps are bright,
    For Seyd, the Pacha, makes a feast to-night:
    A feast for promised triumph yet to come,                           
    When he shall drag the fettered Rovers home;
    This hath he sworn by Allah and his sword,
    And faithful to his firman and his word,
    His summoned prows collect along the coast,
    And great the gathering crews, and loud the boast;
    Already shared the captives and the prize,
    Though far the distant foe they thus despise;
    'Tis but to sail--no doubt to-morrow's Sun
    Will see the Pirates bound--their haven won!
    Meantime the watch may slumber, if they will,                       
    Nor only wake to war, but dreaming kill.
    Though all, who can, disperse on shore and seek
    To flesh their glowing valour on the Greek;
    How well such deed becomes the turbaned brave--
    To bare the sabre's edge before a slave!
    Infest his dwelling--but forbear to slay,
    Their arms are strong, yet merciful to-day,
    And do not deign to smite because they may!
    Unless some gay caprice suggests the blow,
    To keep in practice for the coming foe.                             
    Revel and rout the evening hours beguile,
    And they who wish to wear a head must smile;
    For Moslem mouths produce their choicest cheer,
    And hoard their curses, till the coast is clear.

                    II.

    High in his hall reclines the turbaned Seyd;
    Around--the bearded chiefs he came to lead.
    Removed the banquet, and the last pilaff--
    Forbidden draughts, 'tis said, he dared to quaff,
    Though to the rest the sober berry's juice
    The slaves bear round for rigid Moslems' use;                       
    The long chibouque's dissolving cloud supply,
    While dance the Almas to wild minstrelsy.
    The rising morn will view the chiefs embark;
    But waves are somewhat treacherous in the dark:
    And revellers may more securely sleep
    On silken couch than o'er the rugged deep:
    Feast there who can--nor combat till they must,
    And less to conquest than to Korans trust;
    And yet the numbers crowded in his host
    Might warrant more than even the Pacha's boast.                     

                    III.

    With cautious reverence from the outer gate
    Slow stalks the slave, whose office there to wait,
    Bows his bent head--his hand salutes the floor,
    Ere yet his tongue the trusted tidings bore:
    "A captive Dervise, from the Pirate's nest
    Escaped, is here--himself would tell the rest."
    He took the sign from Seyd's assenting eye,
    And led the holy man in silence nigh.
    His arms were folded on his dark-green vest,
    His step was feeble, and his look deprest;                          
    Yet worn he seemed of hardship more than years,
    And pale his cheek with penance, not from fears.
    Vowed to his God--his sable locks he wore,
    And these his lofty cap rose proudly o'er:
    Around his form his loose long robe was thrown,
    And wrapt a breast bestowed on heaven alone;
    Submissive, yet with self-possession manned,
    He calmly met the curious eyes that scanned;
    And question of his coming fain would seek,
    Before the Pacha's will allowed to speak.                           

                    IV.

    "Whence com'st thou, Dervise?"
                                   "From the Outlaw's den
    A fugitive--"
                   "Thy capture where and when?"
    "From Scalanova's port to Scio's isle,
    The Saick was bound; but Allah did not smile
    Upon our course--the Moslem merchant's gains
    The Rovers won; our limbs have worn their chains.
    I had no death to fear, nor wealth to boast,
    Beyond the wandering freedom which I lost;
    At length a fisher's humble boat by night
    Afforded hope, and offered chance of flight;                        
    I seized the hour, and find my safety here--
    With thee--most mighty Pacha! who can fear?"

    "How speed the outlaws? stand they well prepared,
    Their plundered wealth, and robber's rock, to guard?
    Dream they of this our preparation, doomed
    To view with fire their scorpion nest consumed?"

    "Pacha! the fettered captive's mourning eye,
    That weeps for flight, but ill can play the spy;
    I only heard the reckless waters roar,
    Those waves that would not bear me from the shore;                  
    I only marked the glorious Sun and sky,
    Too bright--too blue--for my captivity;
    And felt that all which Freedom's bosom cheers
    Must break my chain before it dried my tears.
    This mayst thou judge, at least, from my escape,
    They little deem of aught in Peril's shape;
    Else vainly had I prayed or sought the Chance
    That leads me here--if eyed with vigilance:
    The careless guard that did not see me fly,
    May watch as idly when thy power is nigh.                           
    Pacha! my limbs are faint--and nature craves
    Food for my hunger, rest from tossing waves:
    Permit my absence--peace be with thee! Peace
    With all around!--now grant repose--release."

    "Stay, Dervise! I have more to question--stay,
    I do command thee--sit--dost hear?--obey!
    More I must ask, and food the slaves shall bring;
    Thou shall not pine where all are banqueting:
    The supper done--prepare thee to reply,
    Clearly and full--I love not mystery."                              
    'Twere vain to guess what shook the pious man,
    Who looked not lovingly on that Divan;
    Nor showed high relish for the banquet prest,
    And less respect for every fellow guest.
    Twas but a moment's peevish hectic passed
    Along his cheek, and tranquillised as fast:
    He sate him down in silence, and his look
    Resumed the calmness which before forsook:
    The feast was ushered in--but sumptuous fare
    He shunned as if some poison mingled there.                         
    For one so long condemned to toil and fast,
    Methinks he strangely spares the rich repast.
    "What ails thee, Dervise? eat--dost thou suppose
    This feast a Christian's? or my friends thy foes?
    Why dost thou shun the salt? that sacred pledge,
    Which, once partaken, blunts the sabre's edge,
    Makes even contending tribes in peace unite,
    And hated hosts seem brethren to the sight!"

    "Salt seasons dainties--and my food is still
    The humblest root, my drink the simplest rill;                      
    And my stern vow and Order's laws oppose
    To break or mingle bread with friends or foes;
    It may seem strange--if there be aught to dread
    That peril rests upon my single head;
    But for thy sway--nay more--thy Sultan's throne,
    I taste nor bread nor banquet--save alone;
    Infringed our Order's rule, the Prophet's rage
    To Mecca's dome might bar my pilgrimage."

    "Well--as thou wilt--ascetic as thou art--
    One question answer; then in peace depart.                          
    How many?--Ha! it cannot sure be day?
    What Star--what Sun is bursting on the bay?
    It shines a lake of fire!--away--away!
    Ho! treachery! my guards! my scimitar!
    The galleys feed the flames--and I afar!
    Accurs?d Dervise!--these thy tidings--thou
    Some villain spy--seize--cleave him--slay him now!"

    Up rose the Dervise with that burst of light,
    Nor less his change of form appalled the sight:
    Up rose that Dervise--not in saintly garb,                          
    But like a warrior bounding on his barb,
    Dashed his high cap, and tore his robe away--
    Shone his mailed breast, and flashed his sabre's ray!
    His close but glittering casque, and sable plume,
    More glittering eye, and black brow's sabler gloom,
    Glared on the Moslems' eyes some Afrit Sprite,
    Whose demon death-blow left no hope for fight.
    The wild confusion, and the swarthy glow
    Of flames on high, and torches from below;
    The shriek of terror, and the mingling yell--                       
    For swords began to clash, and shouts to swell--
    Flung o'er that spot of earth the air of Hell!
    Distracted, to and fro, the flying slaves
    Behold but bloody shore and fiery waves;
    Nought heeded they the Pacha's angry cry,
    They seize that Dervise!--seize on Zatanai!
    He saw their terror--checked the first despair
    That urged him but to stand and perish there,
    Since far too early and too well obeyed,
    The flame was kindled ere the signal made;                          
    He saw their terror--from his baldric drew
    His bugle--brief the blast--but shrilly blew;
    'Tis answered--"Well ye speed, my gallant crew!
    Why did I doubt their quickness of career?
    And deem design had left me single here?"
    Sweeps his long arm--that sabre's whirling sway
    Sheds fast atonement for its first delay;
    Completes his fury, what their fear begun,
    And makes the many basely quail to one.
    The cloven turbans o'er the chamber spread,                         
    And scarce an arm dare rise to guard its head:
    Even Seyd, convulsed, o'erwhelmed, with rage, surprise,
    Retreats before him, though he still defies.
    No craven he--and yet he dreads the blow,
    So much Confusion magnifies his foe!
    His blazing galleys still distract his sight,
    He tore his beard, and foaming fled the fight;
    For now the pirates passed the Haram gate,
    And burst within--and it were death to wait;
    Where wild Amazement shrieking--kneeling--throws                    
    The sword aside--in vain--the blood o'erflows!
    The Corsairs pouring, haste to where within
    Invited Conrad's bugle, and the din
    Of groaning victims, and wild cries for life,
    Proclaimed how well he did the work of strife.
    They shout to find him grim and lonely there,
    A glutted tiger mangling in his lair!
    But short their greeting, shorter his reply--
    "'Tis well--but Seyd escapes--and he must die--
    Much hath been done--but more remains to do--                       
    Their galleys blaze--why not their city too?"

                    V.

    Quick at the word they seized him each a torch,
    And fire the dome from minaret to porch.
    A stern delight was fixed in Conrad's eye,
    But sudden sunk--for on his ear the cry
    Of women struck, and like a deadly knell
    Knocked at that heart unmoved by Battle's yell.
    "Oh! burst the Haram--wrong not on your lives
    One female form--remember--we have wives.
    On them such outrage Vengeance will repay;                          
    Man is our foe, and such 'tis ours to slay:
    But still we spared--must spare the weaker prey.
    Oh! I forgot--but Heaven will not forgive
    If at my word the helpless cease to live;
    Follow who will--I go--we yet have time
    Our souls to lighten of at least a crime."
    He climbs the crackling stair--he bursts the door,
    Nor feels his feet glow scorching with the floor;
    His breath choked gasping with the volumed smoke,
    But still from room to room his way he broke.                       
    They search--they find--they save: with lusty arms
    Each bears a prize of unregarded charms;
    Calm their loud fears; sustain their sinking frames
    With all the care defenceless Beauty claims:
    So well could Conrad tame their fiercest mood,
    And check the very hands with gore imbrued.
    But who is she? whom Conrad's arms convey,
    From reeking pile and combat's wreck, away--
    Who but the love of him he dooms to bleed?
    The Haram queen--but still the slave of Seyd!                       

                    VI.

    Brief time had Conrad now to greet Gulnare,
    Few words to reassure the trembling Fair;
    For in that pause Compassion snatched from War,
    The foe before retiring, fast and far,
    With wonder saw their footsteps unpursued,
    First slowlier fled--then rallied--then withstood.
    This Seyd perceives, then first perceives how few,
    Compared with his, the Corsair's roving crew,
    And blushes o'er his error, as he eyes
    The ruin wrought by Panic and Surprise.                             
    Alla il Alla! Vengeance swells the cry--
    Shame mounts to rage that must atone or die!
    And flame for flame and blood for blood must tell.
    The tide of triumph ebbs that flowed too well--
    When Wrath returns to renovated strife,
    And those who fought for conquest strike for life.
    Conrad beheld the danger--he beheld
    His followers faint by freshening foes repelled:
    "One effort--one--to break the circling host!"
    They form--unite--charge--waver--all is lost!                       
    Within a narrower ring compressed, beset,
    Hopeless, not heartless, strive and struggle yet--
    Ah! now they fight in firmest file no more,
    Hemmed in--cut off--cleft down and trampled o'er;
    But each strikes singly--silently--and home,
    And sinks outwearied rather than o'ercome--
    His last faint quittance rendering with his breath,
    Till the blade glimmers in the grasp of Death!

                    VII.

    But first, ere came the rallying host to blows,
    And rank to rank, and hand to hand oppose,                          
    Gulnare and all her Haram handmaids freed,
    Safe in the dome of one who held their creed,
    By Conrad's mandate safely were bestowed,
    And dried those tears for life and fame that flowed:
    And when that dark-eyed lady, young Gulnare,
    Recalled those thoughts late wandering in despair,
    Much did she marvel o'er the courtesy
    That smoothed his accents, softened in his eye--
    'Twas strange--that robber thus with gore bedewed,
    Seemed gentler then than Seyd in fondest mood.                      
    The Pacha wooed as if he deemed the slave
    Must seem delighted with the heart he gave;
    The Corsair vowed protection, soothed affright,
    As if his homage were a Woman's right.
    "The wish is wrong--nay, worse for female--vain:
    Yet much I long to view that Chief again;
    If but to thank for, what my fear forgot,
    The life--my loving Lord remembered not!"

                    VIII.

    And him she saw, where thickest carnage spread,
    But gathered breathing from the happier dead;                       
    Far from his band, and battling with a host
    That deem right dearly won the field he lost,
    Felled--bleeding--baffled of the death he sought,
    And snatched to expiate all the ills he wrought;
    Preserved to linger and to live in vain,
    While Vengeance pondered o'er new plans of pain,
    And stanched the blood she saves to shed again--
    But drop by drop, for Seyd's unglutted eye
    Would doom him ever dying--ne'er to die!
    Can this be he? triumphant late she saw,                            
    When his red hand's wild gesture waved, a law!
    'Tis he indeed--disarmed but undeprest,
    His sole regret the life he still possest;
    His wounds too slight, though taken with that will,
    Which would have kissed the hand that then could kill.
    Oh were there none, of all the many given,
    To send his soul--he scarcely asked to Heaven?
    Must he alone of all retain his breath,
    Who more than all had striven and struck for death?
    He deeply felt--what mortal hearts must feel,                       
    When thus reversed on faithless Fortune's wheel,
    For crimes committed, and the victor's threat
    Of lingering tortures to repay the debt--
    He deeply, darkly felt; but evil Pride
    That led to perpetrate--now serves to hide.
    Still in his stern and self-collected mien
    A conqueror's more than captive's air is seen,
    Though faint with wasting toil and stiffening wound,
    But few that saw--so calmly gazed around:
    Though the far shouting of the distant crowd,                       
    Their tremors o'er, rose insolently loud,
    The better warriors who beheld him near,
    Insulted not the foe who taught them fear;
    And the grim guards that to his durance led,
    In silence eyed him with a secret dread.

                    IX.

    The Leech was sent--but not in mercy--there,
    To note how much the life yet left could bear;
    He found enough to load with heaviest chain,
    And promise feeling for the wrench of Pain;
    To-morrow--yea--to-morrow's evening Sun                             
    Will, sinking, see Impalement's pangs begun,
    And rising with the wonted blush of morn
    Behold how well or ill those pangs are borne.
    Of torments this the longest and the worst,
    Which adds all other agony to thirst,
    That day by day Death still forbears to slake,
    While famished vultures flit around the stake.
    "Oh! water--water!"--smiling Hate denies
    The victim's prayer, for if he drinks he dies.
    This was his doom;--the Leech, the guard, were gone,                
    And left proud Conrad fettered and alone.

                    X.

    'Twere vain to paint to what his feelings grew--
    It even were doubtful if their victim knew.
    There is a war, a chaos of the mind,
    When all its elements convulsed, combined
    Lie dark and jarring with perturb?d force,
    And gnashing with impenitent Remorse--
    That juggling fiend, who never spake before,
    But cries "I warned thee!" when the deed is o'er.
    Vain voice! the spirit burning but unbent,                          
    May writhe--rebel--the weak alone repent!
    Even in that lonely hour when most it feels,
    And, to itself, all--all that self reveals,--
    No single passion, and no ruling thought
    That leaves the rest, as once, unseen, unsought,
    But the wild prospect when the Soul reviews,
    All rushing through their thousand avenues--
    Ambition's dreams expiring, Love's regret,
    Endangered Glory, Life itself beset;
    The joy untasted, the contempt or hate                              
    'Gainst those who fain would triumph in our fate;
    The hopeless past, the hasting future driven
    Too quickly on to guess if Hell or Heaven;
    Deeds--thoughts--and words, perhaps remembered not
    So keenly till that hour, but ne'er forgot;
    Things light or lovely in their acted time,
    But now to stern Reflection each a crime;
    The withering sense of Evil unrevealed,
    Not cankering less because the more concealed;
    All, in a word, from which all eyes must start,                     
    That opening sepulchre, the naked heart
    Bares with its buried woes--till Pride awake,
    To snatch the mirror from the soul, and break.
    Aye, Pride can veil, and Courage brave it all--
    All--all--before--beyond--the deadliest fall.
    Each hath some fear, and he who least betrays,
    The only hypocrite deserving praise:
    Not the loud recreant wretch who boasts and flies;
    But he who looks on Death--and silent dies:
    So, steeled by pondering o'er his far career,                       
    He half-way meets Him should He menace near!

                    XI.

    In the high chamber of his highest tower
    Sate Conrad, fettered in the Pacha's power.
    His palace perished in the flame--this fort
    Contained at once his captive and his court.
    Not much could Conrad of his sentence blame,
    His foe, if vanquished, had but shared the same:--
    Alone he sate--in solitude had scanned
    His guilty bosom, but that breast he manned:
    One thought alone he could not--dared not meet--                    
    "Oh, how these tidings will Medora greet?"
    Then--only then--his clanking hands he raised,
    And strained with rage the chain on which he gazed;
    But soon he found, or feigned, or dreamed relief,
    And smiled in self-derision of his grief,
    "And now come Torture when it will, or may--
    More need of rest to nerve me for the day!"
    This said, with langour to his mat he crept,
    And, whatso'er his visions, quickly slept.

    'Twas hardly midnight when that fray begun,                         
    For Conrad's plans matured, at once were done,
    And Havoc loathes so much the waste of time,
    She scarce had left an uncommitted crime.
    One hour beheld him since the tide he stemmed--
    Disguised--discovered--conquering--ta'en--condemned--
    A Chief on land--an outlaw on the deep--
    Destroying--saving--prisoned--and asleep!

                    XII.

    He slept in calmest seeming, for his breath
    Was hushed so deep--Ah! happy if in death!
    He slept--Who o'er his placid slumber bends?                       
    His foes are gone--and here he hath no friends;
    Is it some Seraph sent to grant him grace?
    No,'tis an earthly form with heavenly face!
    Its white arm raised a lamp--yet gently hid,
    Lest the ray flash abruptly on the lid
    Of that closed eye, which opens but to pain,
    And once unclosed--but once may close again.
    That form, with eye so dark, and cheek so fair,
    And auburn waves of gemmed and braided hair;
    With shape of fairy lightness--naked foot,                         
    That shines like snow, and falls on earth as mute--
    Through guards and dunnest night how came it there?
    Ah! rather ask what will not Woman dare?
    Whom Youth and Pity lead like thee, Gulnare!
    She could not sleep--and while the Pacha's rest
    In muttering dreams yet saw his pirate-guest,
    She left his side--his signet-ring she bore,
    Which oft in sport adorned her hand before--
    And with it, scarcely questioned, won her way
    Through drowsy guards that must that sign obey.                    
    Worn out with toil, and tired with changing blows,
    Their eyes had envied Conrad his repose;
    And chill and nodding at the turret door,
    They stretch their listless limbs, and watch no more;
    Just raised their heads to hail the signet-ring,
    Nor ask or what or who the sign may bring.

                    XIII.

    She gazed in wonder, "Can he calmly sleep,
    While other eyes his fall or ravage weep?
    And mine in restlessness are wandering here--
    What sudden spell hath made this man so dear?                      
    True--'tis to him my life, and more, I owe,
    And me and mine he spared from worse than woe:
    'Tis late to think--but soft--his slumber breaks--
    How heavily he sighs!--he starts--awakes!"
    He raised his head, and dazzled with the light,
    His eye seemed dubious if it saw aright:
    He moved his hand--the grating of his chain
    Too harshly told him that he lived again.
    "What is that form? if not a shape of air,
    Methinks, my jailor's face shows wondrous fair!"                   
    "Pirate! thou know'st me not, but I am one,
    Grateful for deeds thou hast too rarely done;
    Look on me--and remember her, thy hand
    Snatched from the flames, and thy more fearful band.
    I come through darkness--and I scarce know why--
    Yet not to hurt--I would not see thee die."

    "If so, kind lady! thine the only eye
    That would not here in that gay hope delight:
    Theirs is the chance--and let them use their right.
    But still I thank their courtesy or thine,                         
    That would confess me at so fair a shrine!"

    Strange though it seem--yet with extremest grief
    Is linked a mirth--it doth not bring relief--
    That playfulness of Sorrow ne'er beguiles,
    And smiles in bitterness--but still it smiles;
    And sometimes with the wisest and the best,
    Till even the scaffold echoes with their jest!
    Yet not the joy to which it seems akin--
    It may deceive all hearts, save that within.
    Whate'er it was that flashed on Conrad, now                        
    A laughing wildness half unbent his brow:
    And these his accents had a sound of mirth,
    As if the last he could enjoy on earth;
    Yet 'gainst his nature--for through that short life,
    Few thoughts had he to spare from gloom and strife.

                    XIV.

    "Corsair! thy doom is named--but I have power
    To soothe the Pacha in his weaker hour.
    Thee would I spare--nay more--would save thee now,
    But this--Time--Hope--nor even thy strength allow;
    But all I can,--I will--at least delay                             
    The sentence that remits thee scarce a day.
    More now were ruin--even thyself were loth
    The vain attempt should bring but doom to both."

    "Yes!--loth indeed:--my soul is nerved to all,
    Or fall'n too low to fear a further fall:
    Tempt not thyself with peril--me with hope
    Of flight from foes with whom I could not cope:
    Unfit to vanquish--shall I meanly fly,
    The one of all my band that would not die?
    Yet there is one--to whom my Memory clings,                        
    Till to these eyes her own wild softness springs.
    My sole resources in the path I trod
    Were these--my bark--my sword--my love--my God!
    The last I left in youth!--He leaves me now--
    And Man but works his will to lay me low.
    I have no thought to mock his throne with prayer
    Wrung from the coward crouching of Despair;
    It is enough--I breathe--and I can bear.
    My sword is shaken from the worthless hand
    That might have better kept so true a brand;                       
    My bark is sunk or captive--but my Love--
    For her in sooth my voice would mount above:
    Oh! she is all that still to earth can bind--
    And this will break a heart so more than kind,
    And blight a form--till thine appeared, Gulnare!
    Mine eye ne'er asked if others were as fair."

    "Thou lov'st another then?--but what to me
    Is this--'tis nothing--nothing e'er can be:
    But yet--thou lov'st--and--Oh! I envy those
    Whose hearts on hearts as faithful can repose,                     
    Who never feel the void--the wandering thought
    That sighs o'er visions--such as mine hath wrought."

    "Lady--methought thy love was his, for whom
    This arm redeemed thee from a fiery tomb."

    "My love stern Seyd's! Oh--No--No--not my love--
    Yet much this heart, that strives no more, once strove
    To meet his passion--but it would not be.
    I felt--I feel--Love dwells with--with the free.
    I am a slave, a favoured slave at best,
    To share his splendour, and seem very blest!                       
    Oft must my soul the question undergo,
    Of--'Dost thou love?' and burn to answer, 'No!'
    Oh! hard it is that fondness to sustain,
    And struggle not to feel averse in vain;
    But harder still the heart's recoil to bear,
    And hide from one--perhaps another there.
    He takes the hand I give not--nor withhold--
    Its pulse nor checked--nor quickened--calmly cold:
    And when resigned, it drops a lifeless weight
    From one I never loved enough to hate.                             
    No warmth these lips return by his imprest,
    And chilled Remembrance shudders o'er the rest.
    Yes--had I ever proved that Passion's zeal,
    The change to hatred were at least to feel:
    But still--he goes unmourned--returns unsought--
    And oft when present--absent from my thought.
    Or when Reflection comes--and come it must--
    I fear that henceforth 'twill but bring disgust;
    I am his slave--but, in despite of pride,
    'Twere worse than bondage to become his bride.                     
    Oh! that this dotage of his breast would cease!
    Or seek another and give mine release,
    But yesterday--I could have said, to peace!
    Yes, if unwonted fondness now I feign,
    Remember--Captive! 'tis to break thy chain;
    Repay the life that to thy hand I owe;
    To give thee back to all endeared below,
    Who share such love as I can never know.
    Farewell--Morn breaks--and I must now away:
    'Twill cost me dear--but dread no death to-day!"                   

                    XV.

    She pressed his fettered fingers to her heart,
    And bowed her head, and turned her to depart,
    And noiseless as a lovely dream is gone.
    And was she here? and is he now alone?
    What gem hath dropped and sparkles o'er his chain?
    The tear most sacred, shed for others' pain,
    That starts at once--bright--pure--from Pity's mine,
    Already polished by the hand divine!
    Oh! too convincing--dangerously dear--
    In Woman's eye the unanswerable tear!                              
    That weapon of her weakness she can wield,
    To save, subdue--at once her spear and shield:
    Avoid it--Virtue ebbs and Wisdom errs,
    Too fondly gazing on that grief of hers!
    What lost a world, and bade a hero fly?
    The timid tear in Cleopatra's eye.
    Yet be the soft Triumvir's fault forgiven;
    By this--how many lose not earth--but Heaven!
    Consign their souls to Man's eternal foe,
    And seal their own to spare some Wanton's woe!                     

                    XVI.

    'Tis Morn--and o'er his altered features play
    The beams--without the Hope of yesterday.
    What shall he be ere night? perchance a thing
    O'er which the raven flaps her funeral wing,
    By his closed eye unheeded and unfelt;
    While sets that Sun, and dews of Evening melt,
    Chill, wet, and misty round each stiffened limb,
    Refreshing earth--reviving all but him!



                      CANTO THE THIRD.

            "Come vedi--ancor non m'abbandona"
                         Dante, Inferno, v. 105.

                    I.

    Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,
    Along Morea's hills the setting Sun;                               
    Not, as in Northern climes, obscurely bright,
    But one unclouded blaze of living light!
    O'er the hushed deep the yellow beam he throws,
    Gilds the green wave, that trembles as it glows.
    On old ?gina's rock, and Idra's isle,
    The God of gladness sheds his parting smile;
    O'er his own regions lingering, loves to shine,
    Though there his altars are no more divine.
    Descending fast the mountain shadows kiss
    Thy glorious gulf, unconquered Salamis!                            
    Their azure arches through the long expanse
    More deeply purpled met his mellowing glance,
    And tenderest tints, along their summits driven,
    Mark his gay course, and own the hues of Heaven;
    Till, darkly shaded from the land and deep,
    Behind his Delphian cliff he sinks to sleep.

    On such an eve, his palest beam he cast,
    When--Athens! here thy Wisest looked his last.
    How watched thy better sons his farewell ray,
    That closed their murdered Sage's latest day!                 
    Not yet--not yet--Sol pauses on the hill--
    The precious hour of parting lingers still;
    But sad his light to agonising eyes,
    And dark the mountain's once delightful dyes:
    Gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour,
    The land, where Phoebus never frowned before:
    But ere he sunk below Cith?ron's head,
    The cup of woe was quaffed--the Spirit fled;
    The Soul of him who scorned to fear or fly--
    Who lived and died, as none can live or die!                       

    But lo! from high Hymettus to the plain,
    The Queen of night asserts her silent reign.
    No murky vapour, herald of the storm,
    Hides her fair face, nor girds her glowing form;
    With cornice glimmering as the moon-beams play,
    There the white column greets her grateful ray,
    And bright around with quivering beams beset,
    Her emblem sparkles o'er the Minaret:
    The groves of olive scattered dark and wide
    Where meek Cephisus pours his scanty tide;                         
    The cypress saddening by the sacred Mosque,
    The gleaming turret of the gay Kiosk;
    And, dun and sombre 'mid the holy calm,
    Near Theseus' fane yon solitary palm,
    All tinged with varied hues arrest the eye--
    And dull were his that passed him heedless by.

    Again the ?gean, heard no more afar,
    Lulls his chafed breast from elemental war;
    Again his waves in milder tints unfold
    Their long array of sapphire and of gold,                          
    Mixed with the shades of many a distant isle,
    That frown--where gentler Ocean seems to smile.

                    II.

    Not now my theme--why turn my thoughts to thee?
    Oh! who can look along thy native sea,
    Nor dwell upon thy name, whate'er the tale,
    So much its magic must o'er all prevail?
    Who that beheld that Sun upon thee set,
    Fair Athens! could thine evening face forget?
    Not he--whose heart nor time nor distance frees,
    Spell-bound within the clustering Cyclades!                        
    Nor seems this homage foreign to its strain,
    His Corsair's isle was once thine own domain--
    Would that with freedom it were thine again!

                    III.

    The Sun hath sunk--and, darker than the night,
    Sinks with its beam upon the beacon height
    Medora's heart--the third day's come and gone--
    With it he comes not--sends not--faithless one!
    The wind was fair though light! and storms were none.
    Last eve Anselmo's bark returned, and yet
    His only tidings that they had not met!                            
    Though wild, as now, far different were the tale
    Had Conrad waited for that single sail.
    The night-breeze freshens--she that day had passed
    In watching all that Hope proclaimed a mast;
    Sadly she sate on high--Impatience bore
    At last her footsteps to the midnight shore,
    And there she wandered, heedless of the spray
    That dashed her garments oft, and warned away:
    She saw not, felt not this--nor dared depart,
    Nor deemed it cold--her chill was at her heart;                    
    Till grew such certainty from that suspense--
    His very Sight had shocked from life or sense!

    It came at last--a sad and shattered boat,
    Whose inmates first beheld whom first they sought;
    Some bleeding--all most wretched--these the few--
    Scarce knew they how escaped--this all they knew.
    In silence, darkling, each appeared to wait
    His fellow's mournful guess at Conrad's fate:
    Something they would have said; but seemed to fear
    To trust their accents to Medora's ear.                            
    She saw at once, yet sunk not--trembled not--
    Beneath that grief, that loneliness of lot,
    Within that meek fair form, were feelings high,
    That deemed not till they found their energy.
    While yet was Hope they softened, fluttered, wept--
    All lost--that Softness died not--but it slept;
    And o'er its slumber rose that Strength which said,
    "With nothing left to love, there's nought to dread."
    'Tis more than Nature's--like the burning might
    Delirium gathers from the fever's height.                          

    "Silent you stand--nor would I hear you tell
    What--speak not--breathe not--for I know it well--
    Yet would I ask--almost my lip denies
    The--quick your answer--tell me where he lies."

    "Lady! we know not--scarce with life we fled;
    But here is one denies that he is dead:
    He saw him bound; and bleeding--but alive."

    She heard no further--'twas in vain to strive--
    So throbbed each vein--each thought--till then withstood;
    Her own dark soul--these words at once subdued:                    
    She totters--falls--and senseless had the wave
    Perchance but snatched her from another grave;
    But that with hands though rude, yet weeping eyes,
    They yield such aid as Pity's haste supplies:
    Dash o'er her deathlike cheek the ocean dew,
    Raise, fan, sustain--till life returns anew;
    Awake her handmaids, with the matrons leave
    That fainting form o'er which they gaze and grieve;
    Then seek Anselmo's cavern, to report
    The tale too tedious--when the triumph short.                      

                    IV.

    In that wild council words waxed warm and strange,
    With thoughts of ransom, rescue, and revenge;
    All, save repose or flight: still lingering there
    Breathed Conrad's spirit, and forbade despair;
    Whate'er his fate--the breasts he formed and led
    Will save him living, or appease him dead.
    Woe to his foes! there yet survive a few,
    Whose deeds are daring, as their hearts are true.

                    V.

    Within the Haram's secret chamber sate
    Stern Seyd, still pondering o'er his Captive's fate;               
    His thoughts on love and hate alternate dwell,
    Now with Gulnare, and now in Conrad's cell;
    Here at his feet the lovely slave reclined
    Surveys his brow--would soothe his gloom of mind;
    While many an anxious glance her large dark eye
    Sends in its idle search for sympathy,
    His only bends in seeming o'er his beads,
    But inly views his victim as he bleeds.

    "Pacha! the day is thine; and on thy crest
    Sits Triumph--Conrad taken--fall'n the rest!                       
    His doom is fixed--he dies; and well his fate
    Was earned--yet much too worthless for thy hate:
    Methinks, a short release, for ransom told
    With all his treasure, not unwisely sold;
    Report speaks largely of his pirate-hoard--
    Would that of this my Pacha were the lord!
    While baffled, weakened by this fatal fray--
    Watched--followed--he were then an easier prey;
    But once cut off--the remnant of his band
    Embark their wealth, and seek a safer strand."     

    "Gulnare!--if for each drop of blood a gem
    Where offered rich as Stamboul's diadem;
    If for each hair of his a massy mine
    Of virgin ore should supplicating shine;
    If all our Arab tales divulge or dream
    Of wealth were here--that gold should not redeem!
    It had not now redeemed a single hour,
    But that I know him fettered, in my power;
    And, thirsting for revenge, I ponder still
    On pangs that longest rack--and latest kill."      

    "Nay, Seyd! I seek not to restrain thy rage,
    Too justly moved for Mercy to assuage;
    My thoughts were only to secure for thee
    His riches--thus released, he were not free:
    Disabled--shorn of half his might and band,
    His capture could but wait thy first command."

    "His capture could!--and shall I then resign
    One day to him--the wretch already mine?
    Release my foe!--at whose remonstrance?--thine!
    Fair suitor!--to thy virtuous gratitude,                           
    That thus repays this Giaour's relenting mood,
    Which thee and thine alone of all could spare--
    No doubt, regardless--if the prize were fair--
    My thanks and praise alike are due--now hear!
    I have a counsel for thy gentler ear:
    I do mistrust thee, Woman! and each word
    Of thine stamps truth on all Suspicion heard.
    Borne in his arms through fire from yon Serai--
    Say, wert thou lingering there with him to fly?
    Thou need'st not answer--thy confession speaks,                    
    Already reddening on thy guilty cheeks:
    Then--lovely Dame--bethink thee! and beware:
    'Tis not his life alone may claim such care!
    Another word and--nay--I need no more.
    Accursed was the moment when he bore
    Thee from the flames, which better far--but no--
    I then had mourned thee with a lover's woe--
    Now 'tis thy lord that warns--deceitful thing!
    Know'st thou that I can clip thy wanton wing?
    In words alone I am not wont to chafe:                             
    Look to thyself--nor deem thy falsehood safe!"

    He rose--and slowly, sternly thence withdrew,
    Rage in his eye, and threats in his adieu:
    Ah! little recked that Chief of womanhood--
    Which frowns ne'er quelled, nor menaces subdued;
    And little deemed he what thy heart, Gulnare!
    When soft could feel--and when incensed could dare!
    His doubts appeared to wrong--nor yet she knew
    How deep the root from whence Compassion grew--
    She was a slave--from such may captives claim                      
    A fellow-feeling, differing but in name;
    Still half unconscious--heedless of his wrath,
    Again she ventured on the dangerous path,
    Again his rage repelled--until arose
    That strife of thought, the source of Woman's woes!

                    VI.

    Meanwhile--long--anxious--weary--still the same
    Rolled day and night: his soul could Terror tame--
    This fearful interval of doubt and dread,
    When every hour might doom him worse than dead;
    When every step that echoed by the gate,                           
    Might entering lead where axe and stake await;
    When every voice that grated on his ear
    Might be the last that he could ever hear;
    Could Terror tame--that Spirit stern and high
    Had proved unwilling as unfit to die;
    'Twas worn--perhaps decayed--yet silent bore
    That conflict, deadlier far than all before:
    The heat of fight, the hurry of the gale,
    Leave scarce one thought inert enough to quail:
    But bound and fixed in fettered solitude,                          
    To pine, the prey of every changing mood;
    To gaze on thine own heart--and meditate
    Irrevocable faults, and coming fate--
    Too late the last to shun--the first to mend--
    To count the hours that struggle to thine end,
    With not a friend to animate and tell
    To other ears that Death became thee well;
    Around thee foes to forge the ready lie,
    And blot Life's latest scene with calumny;
    Before thee tortures, which the Soul can dare,                     
    Yet doubts how well the shrinking flesh may bear;
    But deeply feels a single cry would shame,
    To Valour's praise thy last and dearest claim;
    The life thou leav'st below, denied above
    By kind monopolists of heavenly love;
    And more than doubtful Paradise--thy Heaven
    Of earthly hope--thy loved one from thee riven.
    Such were the thoughts that outlaw must sustain,
    And govern pangs surpassing mortal pain:
    And those sustained he--boots it well or ill?                      
    Since not to sink beneath, is something still!

                    VII.

    The first day passed--he saw not her--Gulnare--
    The second, third--and still she came not there;
    But what her words avouched, her charms had done,
    Or else he had not seen another Sun.
    The fourth day rolled along, and with the night
    Came storm and darkness in their mingling might.
    Oh! how he listened to the rushing deep,
    That ne'er till now so broke upon his sleep;
    And his wild Spirit wilder wishes sent,                            
    Roused by the roar of his own element!
    Oft had he ridden on that wing?d wave,
    And loved its roughness for the speed it gave;
    And now its dashing echoed on his ear,
    A long known voice--alas! too vainly near!
    Loud sung the wind above; and, doubly loud,
    Shook o'er his turret cell the thunder-cloud;
    And flashed the lightning by the latticed bar,
    To him more genial than the Midnight Star:
    Close to the glimmering grate he dragged his chain,                
    And hoped that peril might not prove in vain.
    He rais'd his iron hand to Heaven, and prayed
    One pitying flash to mar the form it made:
    His steel and impious prayer attract alike--
    The storm rolled onward, and disdained to strike;
    Its peal waxed fainter--ceased--he felt alone,
    As if some faithless friend had spurned his groan!

                    VIII.

    The midnight passed, and to the massy door
    A light step came--it paused--it moved once more;
    Slow turns the grating bolt and sullen key:                        
    'Tis as his heart foreboded--that fair She!
    Whate'er her sins, to him a Guardian Saint,
    And beauteous still as hermit's hope can paint;
    Yet changed since last within that cell she came,
    More pale her cheek, more tremulous her frame:
    On him she cast her dark and hurried eye,
    Which spoke before her accents--"Thou must die!
    Yes, thou must die--there is but one resource,
    The last--the worst--if torture were not worse."

    "Lady! I look to none; my lips proclaim                            
    What last proclaimed they--Conrad still the same:
    Why should'st thou seek an outlaw's life to spare,
    And change the sentence I deserve to bear?
    Well have I earned--nor here alone--the meed
    Of Seyd's revenge, by many a lawless deed."

    "Why should I seek? because--Oh! did'st thou not
    Redeem my life from worse than Slavery's lot?
    Why should I seek?--hath Misery made thee blind
    To the fond workings of a woman's mind?
    And must I say?--albeit my heart rebel                             
    With all that Woman feels, but should not tell--
    Because--despite thy crimes--that heart is moved:
    It feared thee--thanked thee--pitied--maddened--loved.
    Reply not, tell not now thy tale again,
    Thou lov'st another--and I love in vain:
    Though fond as mine her bosom, form more fair,
    I rush through peril which she would not dare.
    If that thy heart to hers were truly dear,
    Were I thine own--thou wert not lonely here:
    An outlaw's spouse--and leave her Lord to roam!                    
    What hath such gentle dame to do with home?
    But speak not now--o'er thine and o'er my head
    Hangs the keen sabre by a single thread;
    If thou hast courage still, and would'st be free,
    Receive this poniard--rise and follow me!"

    "Aye--in my chains! my steps will gently tread,
    With these adornments, o'er such slumbering head!
    Thou hast forgot--is this a garb for flight?
    Or is that instrument more fit for fight?"

    "Misdoubting Corsair! I have gained the guard,                     
    Ripe for revolt, and greedy for reward.
    A single word of mine removes that chain:
    Without some aid how here could I remain?
    Well, since we met, hath sped my busy time,
    If in aught evil, for thy sake the crime:
    The crime--'tis none to punish those of Seyd.
    That hatred tyrant, Conrad--he must bleed!
    I see thee shudder, but my soul is changed--
    Wronged--spurned--reviled--and it shall be avenged--
    Accused of what till now my heart disdained--                      
    Too faithful, though to bitter bondage chained.
    Yes, smile!--but he had little cause to sneer,
    I was not treacherous then, nor thou too dear:
    But he has said it--and the jealous well,--
    Those tyrants--teasing--tempting to rebel,--
    Deserve the fate their fretting lips foretell.
    I never loved--he bought me--somewhat high--
    Since with me came a heart he could not buy.
    I was a slave unmurmuring; he hath said,
    But for his rescue I with thee had fled.                           
    'Twas false thou know'st--but let such Augurs rue,
    Their words are omens Insult renders true.
    Nor was thy respite granted to my prayer;
    This fleeting grace was only to prepare
    New torments for thy life, and my despair.
    Mine too he threatens; but his dotage still
    Would fain reserve me for his lordly will:
    When wearier of these fleeting charms and me,
    There yawns the sack--and yonder rolls the sea!
    What, am I then a toy for dotard's play,                           
    To wear but till the gilding frets away?
    I saw thee--loved thee--owe thee all--would save,
    If but to show how grateful is a slave.
    But had he not thus menaced fame and life,--
    And well he keeps his oaths pronounced in strife--
    I still had saved thee--but the Pacha spared:
    Now I am all thine own--for all prepared:
    Thou lov'st me not--nor know'st--or but the worst.
    Alas! this love--that hatred--are the first--
    Oh! could'st thou prove my truth, thou would'st not start,         
    Nor fear the fire that lights an Eastern heart;
    'Tis now the beacon of thy safety--now
    It points within the port a Mainote prow:
    But in one chamber, where our path must lead,
    There sleeps--he must not wake--the oppressor Seyd!"

    "Gulnare--Gulnare--I never felt till now
    My abject fortune, withered fame so low:
    Seyd is mine enemy; had swept my band
    From earth with ruthless but with open hand,
    And therefore came I, in my bark of war,                           
    To smite the smiter with the scimitar;
    Such is my weapon--not the secret knife;
    Who spares a Woman's seeks not Slumber's life.
    Thine saved I gladly, Lady--not for this;
    Let me not deem that mercy shown amiss.
    Now fare thee well--more peace be with thy breast!
    Night wears apace, my last of earthly rest!"

    "Rest! rest! by sunrise must thy sinews shake,
    And thy limbs writhe around the ready stake,
    I heard the order--saw--I will not see--                           
    If thou wilt perish, I will fall with thee.
    My life--my love--my hatred--all below
    Are on this cast--Corsair! 'tis but a blow!
    Without it flight were idle--how evade
    His sure pursuit?--my wrongs too unrepaid,
    My youth disgraced--the long, long wasted years,
    One blow shall cancel with our future fears;
    But since the dagger suits thee less than brand,
    I'll try the firmness of a female hand.
    The guards are gained--one moment all were o'er--                  
    Corsair! we meet in safety or no more;
    If errs my feeble hand, the morning cloud
    Will hover o'er thy scaffold, and my shroud."

                    IX.

    She turned, and vanished ere he could reply,
    But his glance followed far with eager eye;
    And gathering, as he could, the links that bound
    His form, to curl their length, and curb their sound,
    Since bar and bolt no more his steps preclude,
    He, fast as fettered limbs allow, pursued.
    'Twas dark and winding, and he knew not where                      
    That passage led; nor lamp nor guard was there:
    He sees a dusky glimmering--shall he seek
    Or shun that ray so indistinct and weak?
    Chance guides his steps--a freshness seems to bear
    Full on his brow as if from morning air;
    He reached an open gallery--on his eye
    Gleamed the last star of night, the clearing sky:
    Yet scarcely heeded these--another light
    From a lone chamber struck upon his sight.
    Towards it he moved; a scarcely closing door                       
    Revealed the ray within, but nothing more.
    With hasty step a figure outward passed,
    Then paused, and turned--and paused--'tis She at last!
    No poniard in that hand, nor sign of ill--
    "Thanks to that softening heart--she could not kill!"
    Again he looked, the wildness of her eye
    Starts from the day abrupt and fearfully.
    She stopped--threw back her dark far-floating hair,
    That nearly veiled her face and bosom fair,
    As if she late had bent her leaning head                           
    Above some object of her doubt or dread.
    They meet--upon her brow--unknown--forgot--
    Her hurrying hand had left--'twas but a spot--
    Its hue was all he saw, and scarce withstood--
    Oh! slight but certain pledge of crime--'tis Blood!

                    X.

    He had seen battle--he had brooded lone
    O'er promised pangs to sentenced Guilt foreshown;
    He had been tempted--chastened--and the chain
    Yet on his arms might ever there remain:
    But ne'er from strife--captivity--remorse--                        
    From all his feelings in their inmost force--
    So thrilled, so shuddered every creeping vein,
    As now they froze before that purple stain.
    That spot of blood, that light but guilty streak,
    Had banished all the beauty from her cheek!
    Blood he had viewed--could view unmoved--but then
    It flowed in combat, or was shed by men!

                    XI.

    "'Tis done--he nearly waked--but it is done.
    Corsair! he perished--thou art dearly won.
    All words would now be vain--away--away!                           
    Our bark is tossing--'tis already day.
    The few gained over, now are wholly mine,
    And these thy yet surviving band shall join:
    Anon my voice shall vindicate my hand,
    When once our sail forsakes this hated strand."

                    XII.

    She clapped her hands, and through the gallery pour,
    Equipped for flight, her vassals--Greek and Moor;
    Silent but quick they stoop, his chains unbind;
    Once more his limbs are free as mountain wind!
    But on his heavy heart such sadness sate,                          
    As if they there transferred that iron weight.
    No words are uttered--at her sign, a door
    Reveals the secret passage to the shore;
    The city lies behind--they speed, they reach
    The glad waves dancing on the yellow beach;
    And Conrad following, at her beck, obeyed,
    Nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed;
    Resistance were as useless as if Seyd
    Yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed.

                    XIII.

    Embarked--the sail unfurled--the light breeze blew--               
    How much had Conrad's memory to review!
    Sunk he in contemplation, till the Cape
    Where last he anchored reared its giant shape.
    Ah!--since that fatal night, though brief the time,
    Had swept an age of terror, grief, and crime.
    As its far shadow frowned above the mast,
    He veiled his face, and sorrowed as he passed;
    He thought of all--Gonsalvo and his band,
    His fleeting triumph and his failing hand;
    He thought on her afar, his lonely bride:                          
    He turned and saw--Gulnare, the Homicide!

                    XIV.

    She watched his features till she could not bear
    Their freezing aspect and averted air;
    And that strange fierceness foreign to her eye
    Fell quenched in tears, too late to shed or dry.
    She knelt beside him and his hand she pressed,
    "Thou may'st forgive though Allah's self detest;
    But for that deed of darkness what wert thou?
    Reproach me--but not yet--Oh! spare me now!
    I am not what I seem--this fearful night                           
    My brain bewildered--do not madden quite!
    If I had never loved--though less my guilt--
    Thou hadst not lived to--hate me--if thou wilt."

                    XV.

    She wrongs his thoughts--they more himself upbraid
    Than her--though undesigned--the wretch he made;
    But speechless all, deep, dark, and unexprest,
    They bleed within that silent cell--his breast.
    Still onward, fair the breeze, nor rough the surge,
    The blue waves sport around the stern they urge;
    Far on the Horizon's verge appears a speck,                        
    A spot--a mast--a sail--an arm?d deck!
    Their little bark her men of watch descry,
    And ampler canvass woos the wind from high;
    She bears her down majestically near,
    Speed on her prow, and terror in her tier;
    A flash is seen--the ball beyond her bow
    Booms harmless, hissing to the deep below.
    Up rose keen Conrad from his silent trance,
    A long, long absent gladness in his glance;
    "'Tis mine--my blood-rag flag! again--again--                      
    I am not all deserted on the main!"
    They own the signal, answer to the hail,
    Hoist out the boat at once, and slacken sail.
    "'Tis Conrad! Conrad!" shouting from the deck,
    Command nor Duty could their transport check!
    With light alacrity and gaze of Pride,
    They view him mount once more his vessel's side;
    A smile relaxing in each rugged face,
    Their arms can scarce forbear a rough embrace.
    He, half forgetting danger and defeat,                             
    Returns their greeting as a Chief may greet,
    Wrings with a cordial grasp Anselmo's hand,
    And feels he yet can conquer and command!

                    XVI.

    These greetings o'er, the feelings that o'erflow,
    Yet grieve to win him back without a blow;
    They sailed prepared for vengeance--had they known
    A woman's hand secured that deed her own,
    She were their Queen--less scrupulous are they
    Than haughty Conrad how they win their way.
    With many an asking smile, and wondering stare,                    
    They whisper round, and gaze upon Gulnare;
    And her, at once above--beneath her sex,
    Whom blood appalled not, their regards perplex.
    To Conrad turns her faint imploring eye,
    She drops her veil, and stands in silence by;
    Her arms are meekly folded on that breast,
    Which--Conrad safe--to Fate resigned the rest.
    Though worse than frenzy could that bosom fill,
    Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,
    The worst of crimes had left her Woman still!                      

                    XVII.

    This Conrad marked, and felt--ah! could he less?--
    Hate of that deed--but grief for her distress;
    What she has done no tears can wash away,
    And Heaven must punish on its angry day:
    But--it was done: he knew, whate'er her guilt,
    For him that poniard smote, that blood was spilt;
    And he was free!--and she for him had given
    Her all on earth, and more than all in heaven!
    And now he turned him to that dark-eyed slave
    Whose brow was bowed beneath the glance he gave,                   
    Who now seemed changed and humbled, faint and meek,
    But varying oft the colour of her cheek
    To deeper shades of paleness--all its red
    That fearful spot which stained it from the dead!
    He took that hand--it trembled--now too late--
    So soft in love--so wildly nerved in hate;
    He clasped that hand--it trembled--and his own
    Had lost its firmness, and his voice its tone.
    "Gulnare!"--but she replied not--"dear Gulnare!"
    She raised her eye--her only answer there--                        
    At once she sought and sunk in his embrace:
    If he had driven her from that resting-place,
    His had been more or less than mortal heart,
    But--good or ill--it bade her not depart.
    Perchance, but for the bodings of his breast,
    His latest virtue then had joined the rest.
    Yet even Medora might forgive the kiss
    That asked from form so fair no more than this,
    The first, the last that Frailty stole from Faith--
    To lips where Love had lavished all his breath,                    
    To lips--whose broken sighs such fragrance fling,
    As he had fanned them freshly with his wing!

                    XVIII.

    They gain by twilight's hour their lonely isle.
    To them the very rocks appear to smile;
    The haven hums with many a cheering sound,
    The beacons blaze their wonted stations round,
    The boats are darting o'er the curly bay,
    And sportive Dolphins bend them through the spray;
    Even the hoarse sea-bird's shrill, discordant shriek,
    Greets like the welcome of his tuneless beak!                      
    Beneath each lamp that through its lattice gleams,
    Their fancy paints the friends that trim the beams.
    Oh! what can sanctify the joys of home,
    Like Hope's gay glance from Ocean's troubled foam?

                    XIX.

    The lights are high on beacon and from bower,
    And 'midst them Conrad seeks Medora's tower:
    He looks in vain--'tis strange--and all remark,
    Amid so many, hers alone is dark.
    'Tis strange--of yore its welcome never failed,
    Nor now, perchance, extinguished--only veiled.                     
    With the first boat descends he for the shore,
    And looks impatient on the lingering oar.
    Oh! for a wing beyond the falcon's flight,
    To bear him like an arrow to that height!
    With the first pause the resting rowers gave,
    He waits not--looks not--leaps into the wave,
    Strives through the surge, bestrides the beach, and high
    Ascends the path familiar to his eye.

    He reached his turret door--he paused--no sound
    Broke from within; and all was night around.                       
    He knocked, and loudly--footstep nor reply
    Announced that any heard or deemed him nigh:
    He knocked, but faintly--for his trembling hand
    Refused to aid his heavy heart's demand.
    The portal opens--'tis a well known face--
    But not the form he panted to embrace.
    Its lips are silent--twice his own essayed,
    And failed to frame the question they delayed;
    He snatched the lamp--its light will answer all--
    It quits his grasp, expiring in the fall.                          
    He would not wait for that reviving ray--
    As soon could he have lingered there for day;
    But, glimmering through the dusky corridor,
    Another chequers o'er the shadowed floor;
    His steps the chamber gain--his eyes behold
    All that his heart believed not--yet foretold!

                    XX.

    He turned not--spoke not--sunk not--fixed his look,
    And set the anxious frame that lately shook:
    He gazed--how long we gaze despite of pain,
    And know, but dare not own, we gaze in vain!                       
    In life itself she was so still and fair,
    That Death with gentler aspect withered there;
    And the cold flowers her colder hand contained,
    In that last grasp as tenderly were strained
    As if she scarcely felt, but feigned a sleep--
    And made it almost mockery yet to weep:
    The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow,
    And veiled--Thought shrinks from all that lurked below--Oh!
    o'er the eye Death most exerts his might,
    And hurls the Spirit from her throne of light;                     
    Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse,
    But spares, as yet, the charm around her lips--
    Yet, yet they seem as they forebore to smile,
    And wished repose,--but only for a while;
    But the white shroud, and each extended tress,
    Long, fair--but spread in utter lifelessness,
    Which, late the sport of every summer wind,
    Escaped the baffled wreath that strove to bind;
    These--and the pale pure cheek, became the bier--
    But She is nothing--wherefore is he here?                          

                    XXI.

    He asked no question--all were answered now
    By the first glance on that still, marble brow.
    It was enough--she died--what recked it how?
    The love of youth, the hope of better years,
    The source of softest wishes, tenderest fears,
    The only living thing he could not hate,
    Was reft at once--and he deserved his fate,
    But did not feel it less;--the Good explore,
    For peace, those realms where Guilt can never soar:
    The proud, the wayward--who have fixed below                       
    Their joy, and find this earth enough for woe,
    Lose in that one their all--perchance a mite--
    But who in patience parts with all delight?
    Full many a stoic eye and aspect stern
    Mask hearts where Grief hath little left to learn;
    And many a withering thought lies hid, not lost,
    In smiles that least befit who wear them most.

                    XXII.

    By those, that deepest feel, is ill exprest
    The indistinctness of the suffering breast;
    Where thousand thoughts begin to end in one,                       
    Which seeks from all the refuge found in none;
    No words suffice the secret soul to show,
    For Truth denies all eloquence to Woe.
    On Conrad's stricken soul Exhaustion prest,
    And Stupor almost lulled it into rest;
    So feeble now--his mother's softness crept
    To those wild eyes, which like an infant's wept:
    It was the very weakness of his brain,
    Which thus confessed without relieving pain.
    None saw his trickling tears--perchance, if seen,                  
    That useless flood of grief had never been:
    Nor long they flowed--he dried them to depart,
    In helpless--hopeless--brokenness of heart:
    The Sun goes forth, but Conrad's day is dim:
    And the night cometh--ne'er to pass from him.
    There is no darkness like the cloud of mind,
    On Grief's vain eye--the blindest of the blind!
    Which may not--dare not see--but turns aside
    To blackest shade--nor will endure a guide!

                    XXIII.

    His heart was formed for softness--warped to wrong,                
    Betrayed too early, and beguiled too long;
    Each feeling pure--as falls the dropping dew
    Within the grot--like that had hardened too;
    Less clear, perchance, its earthly trials passed,
    But sunk, and chilled, and petrified at last.
    Yet tempests wear, and lightning cleaves the rock;
    If such his heart, so shattered it the shock.
    There grew one flower beneath its rugged brow,
    Though dark the shade--it sheltered--saved till now.
    The thunder came--that bolt hath blasted both,                     
    The Granite's firmness, and the Lily's growth:
    The gentle plant hath left no leaf to tell
    Its tale, but shrunk and withered where it fell;
    And of its cold protector, blacken round
    But shivered fragments on the barren ground!

                    XXIV.

    'Tis morn--to venture on his lonely hour
    Few dare; though now Anselmo sought his tower.
    He was not there, nor seen along the shore;
    Ere night, alarmed, their isle is traversed o'er:
    Another morn--another bids them seek,                              
    And shout his name till Echo waxeth weak;
    Mount--grotto--cavern--valley searched in vain,
    They find on shore a sea-boat's broken chain:
    Their hope revives--they follow o'er the main.
    'Tis idle all--moons roll on moons away,
    And Conrad comes not, came not since that day:
    Nor trace nor tidings of his doom declare
    Where lives his grief, or perished his despair!
    Long mourned his band whom none could mourn beside;
    And fair the monument they gave his Bride:                         
    For him they raise not the recording stone--
    His death yet dubious, deeds too widely known;
    He left a Corsair's name to other times,
    Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.




                ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.

                    I.

    'Tis done--but yesterday a King!
      And armed with Kings to strive--
    And now thou art a nameless thing:
      So abject--yet alive!
    Is this the man of thousand thrones,
    Who strewed our earth with hostile bones,
      And can he thus survive?
    Since he, miscalled the Morning Star,
    Nor man nor fiend hath fallen so far.

                    II.

    Ill-minded man! why scourge thy kind
      Who bowed so low the knee?
    By gazing on thyself grown blind,
      Thou taught'st the rest to see.
    With might unquestioned,--power to save,--
    Thine only gift hath been the grave
      To those that worshipped thee;
    Nor till thy fall could mortals guess
    Ambition's less than littleness!

                    III.

    Thanks for that lesson--it will teach
      To after-warriors more
    Than high Philosophy can preach,
      And vainly preached before.
    That spell upon the minds of men
    Breaks never to unite again,
      That led them to adore
    Those Pagod things of sabre-sway,
    With fronts of brass, and feet of clay.

                    IV.

    The triumph, and the vanity,
      The rapture of the strife--
    The earthquake-voice of Victory,
      To thee the breath of life;
    The sword, the sceptre, and that sway
    Which man seemed made but to obey,
      Wherewith renown was rife--
    All quelled!--Dark Spirit! what must be
    The madness of thy memory!

                    V.

    The Desolator desolate!
      The Victor overthrown!
    The Arbiter of others' fate
      A Suppliant for his own!
    Is it some yet imperial hope
    That with such change can calmly cope?
      Or dread of death alone?
    To die a Prince--or live a slave--
    Thy choice is most ignobly brave!

                    VI.

    He who of old would rend the oak,
      Dreamed not of the rebound;
    Chained by the trunk he vainly broke--
      Alone--how looked he round?
    Thou, in the sternness of thy strength,
    An equal deed hast done at length.
      And darker fate hast found:
    He fell, the forest prowlers' prey;
    But thou must eat thy heart away!

                    VII.

    The Roman, when his burning heart
      Was slaked with blood of Rome,
    Threw down the dagger--dared depart,
      In savage grandeur, home.--
    He dared depart in utter scorn
    Of men that such a yoke had borne,
      Yet left him such a doom!
    His only glory was that hour
    Of self-upheld abandoned power.

                    VIII.

    The Spaniard, when the lust of sway
      Had lost its quickening spell,
    Cast crowns for rosaries away,
      An empire for a cell;
    A strict accountant of his beads,
    A subtle disputant on creeds,
      His dotage trifled well:
    Yet better had he neither known
    A bigot's shrine, nor despot's throne.

                    IX.

    But thou--from thy reluctant hand
      The thunderbolt is wrung--
    Too late thou leav'st the high command
      To which thy weakness clung;
    All Evil Spirit as thou art,
    It is enough to grieve the heart
      To see thine own unstrung;
    To think that God's fair world hath been
    The footstool of a thing so mean;

                    X.

    And Earth hath spilt her blood for him,
      Who thus can hoard his own!
    And Monarchs bowed the trembling limb,
      And thanked him for a throne!
    Fair Freedom! we may hold thee dear,
    When thus thy mightiest foes their fear
      In humblest guise have shown.
    Oh! ne'er may tyrant leave behind
    A brighter name to lure mankind!

                    XI.

    Thine evil deeds are writ in gore,
      Nor written thus in vain--
    Thy triumphs tell of fame no more,
      Or deepen every stain:
    If thou hadst died as Honour dies,
    Some new Napoleon might arise,
      To shame the world again--
    But who would soar the solar height,
    To set in such a starless night?

                    XII.

    Weigh'd in the balance, hero dust
      Is vile as vulgar clay;
    Thy scales, Mortality! are just
      To all that pass away:
    But yet methought the living great
    Some higher sparks should animate,
      To dazzle and dismay:
    Nor deem'd Contempt could thus make mirth
    Of these, the Conquerors of the earth.

                    XIII.

    And she, proud Austria's mournful flower,
      Thy still imperial bride;
    How bears her breast the torturing hour?
      Still clings she to thy side?
    Must she too bend, must she too share
    Thy late repentance, long despair,
      Thou throneless Homicide?
    If still she loves thee, hoard that gem,--
    'Tis worth thy vanished diadem!

                    XIV.

    Then haste thee to thy sullen Isle,
      And gaze upon the sea;
    That element may meet thy smile--
      It ne'er was ruled by thee!
    Or trace with thine all idle hand
    In loitering mood upon the sand
      That Earth is now as free!
    That Corinth's pedagogue hath now
    Transferred his by-word to thy brow.

                    XV.

    Thou Timour! in his captive's cage
      What thoughts will there be thine,
    While brooding in thy prisoned rage?
      But one--"The world was mine!"
    Unless, like he of Babylon,
    All sense is with thy sceptre gone,
      Life will not long confine
    That spirit poured so widely forth--
    So long obeyed--so little worth!

                    XVI.

    Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,
      Wilt thou withstand the shock?
    And share with him, the unforgiven,
      His vulture and his rock!
    Foredoomed by God--by man accurst,
    And that last act, though not thy worst,
      The very Fiend's arch mock;
    He in his fall preserved his pride,
    And, if a mortal, had as proudly died!

                    XVII.

    There was a day--there was an hour,
      While earth was Gaul's--Gaul thine--
    When that immeasurable power
      Unsated to resign
    Had been an act of purer fame
    Than gathers round Marengo's name
      And gilded thy decline,
    Through the long twilight of all time,
    Despite some passing clouds of crime.

                    XVIII.

    But thou forsooth must be a King
      And don the purple vest,
    As if that foolish robe could wring
      Remembrance from thy breast.
    Where is that faded garment? where
    The gewgaws thou wert fond to wear,
      The star, the string, the crest?
    Vain froward child of Empire! say,
    Are all thy playthings snatched away?

                    XIX.

    Where may the wearied eye repose
      When gazing on the Great;
    Where neither guilty glory glows,
      Nor despicable state?
    Yes--One--the first--the last--the best--
    The Cincinnatus of the West,
      Whom Envy dared not hate,
    Bequeathed the name of Washington,
    To make man blush there was but one!





                                LARA.



                   CANTO THE FIRST.

                    I.

    The Serfs are glad through Lara's wide domain,
    And Slavery half forgets her feudal chain;
    He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,
    The long self-exiled Chieftain, is restored:
    There be bright faces in the busy hall,
    Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;
    Far checkering o'er the pictured window, plays
    The unwonted faggot's hospitable blaze;
    And gay retainers gather round the hearth,
    With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth.                  

                    II.

    The Chief of Lara is returned again:
    And why had Lara crossed the bounding main?
    Left by his Sire, too young such loss to know,
    Lord of himself,--that heritage of woe,
    That fearful empire which the human breast
    But holds to rob the heart within of rest!--
    With none to check, and few to point in time
    The thousand paths that slope the way to crime;
    Then, when he most required commandment, then
    Had Lara's daring boyhood governed men.                          
    It skills not, boots not step by step to trace
    His youth through all the mazes of its race;
    Short was the course his restlessness had run,
    But long enough to leave him half undone.

                    III.

    And Lara left in youth his father-land;
    But from the hour he waved his parting hand
    Each trace waxed fainter of his course, till all
    Had nearly ceased his memory to recall.
    His sire was dust, his vassals could declare,
    'Twas all they knew, that Lara was not there;                        
    Nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew
    Cold in the many, anxious in the few.
    His hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,
    His portrait darkens in its fading frame,
    Another chief consoled his destined bride,
    The young forgot him, and the old had died;
    "Yet doth he live!" exclaims the impatient heir,
    And sighs for sables which he must not wear.
    A hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace
    The Laras' last and longest dwelling-place;                          
    But one is absent from the mouldering file,
    That now were welcome in that Gothic pile.

                    IV.

    He comes at last in sudden loneliness,
    And whence they know not, why they need not guess;
    They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er
    Not that he came, but came not long before:
    No train is his beyond a single page,
    Of foreign aspect, and of tender age.
    Years had rolled on, and fast they speed away
    To those that wander as to those that stay;                          
    But lack of tidings from another clime
    Had lent a flagging wing to weary Time.
    They see, they recognise, yet almost deem
    The present dubious, or the past a dream.

    He lives, nor yet is past his Manhood's prime,
    Though seared by toil, and something touched by Time;
    His faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,
    Might be untaught him by his varied lot;
    Nor good nor ill of late were known, his name
    Might yet uphold his patrimonial fame:                               
    His soul in youth was haughty, but his sins
    No more than pleasure from the stripling wins;
    And such, if not yet hardened in their course,
    Might be redeemed, nor ask a long remorse.

                    V.

    And they indeed were changed--'tis quickly seen,
    Whate'er he be, 'twas not what he had been:
    That brow in furrowed lines had fixed at last,
    And spake of passions, but of passion past:
    The pride, but not the fire, of early days,
    Coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;                        
    A high demeanour, and a glance that took
    Their thoughts from others by a single look;
    And that sarcastic levity of tongue,
    The stinging of a heart the world hath stung,
    That darts in seeming playfulness around,
    And makes those feel that will not own the wound;
    All these seemed his, and something more beneath
    Than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe.
    Ambition, Glory, Love, the common aim,
    That some can conquer, and that all would claim,                     
    Within his breast appeared no more to strive,
    Yet seemed as lately they had been alive;
    And some deep feeling it were vain to trace
    At moments lightened o'er his livid face.

                    VI.

    Not much he loved long question of the past,
    Nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,
    In those far lands where he had wandered lone,
    And--as himself would have it seem--unknown:
    Yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,
    Nor glean experience from his fellow man;                            
    But what he had beheld he shunned to show,
    As hardly worth a stranger's care to know;
    If still more prying such inquiry grew,
    His brow fell darker, and his words more few.

                    VII.

    Not unrejoiced to see him once again,
    Warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;
    Born of high lineage, linked in high command,
    He mingled with the Magnates of his land;
    Joined the carousals of the great and gay,
    And saw them smile or sigh their hours away;                        
    But still he only saw, and did not share,
    The common pleasure or the general care;
    He did not follow what they all pursued
    With hope still baffled still to be renewed;
    Nor shadowy Honour, nor substantial Gain,
    Nor Beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:
    Around him some mysterious circle thrown
    Repelled approach, and showed him still alone;
    Upon his eye sat something of reproof,
    That kept at least Frivolity aloof;                                 
    And things more timid that beheld him near
    In silence gazed, or whispered mutual fear;
    And they the wiser, friendlier few confessed
    They deemed him better than his air expressed.

                    VIII.

    Twas strange--in youth all action and all life,
    Burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;
    Woman--the Field--the Ocean, all that gave
    Promise of gladness, peril of a grave,
    In turn he tried--he ransacked all below,
    And found his recompense in joy or woe,                             
    No tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought
    In that intenseness an escape from thought:
    The Tempest of his Heart in scorn had gazed
    On that the feebler Elements hath raised;
    The Rapture of his Heart had looked on high,
    And asked if greater dwelt beyond the sky:
    Chained to excess, the slave of each extreme,
    How woke he from the wildness of that dream!
    Alas! he told not--but he did awake
    To curse the withered heart that would not break.                   

                    IX.

    Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,
    With eye more curious he appeared to scan,
    And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,
    From all communion he would start away:
    And then, his rarely called attendants said,
    Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread
    O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned
    In rude but antique portraiture around:
    They heard, but whispered--"that must not be known--
    The sound of words less earthly than his own.                   
    Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen
    They scarce knew what, but more than should have been.
    Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head
    Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,
    That still beside his opened volume lay,
    As if to startle all save him away?
    Why slept he not when others were at rest?
    Why heard no music, and received no guest?
    All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?
    Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;                    
    And such besides were too discreetly wise,
    To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;
    But if they would--they could"--around the board
    Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.

                    X.

    It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream
    The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;
    So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,
    And yet they glide like Happiness away;
    Reflecting far and fairy-like from high
    The immortal lights that live along the sky:                        
    Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,
    And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;
    Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,
    And Innocence would offer to her love.
    These deck the shore; the waves their channel make
    In windings bright and mazy like the snake.
    All was so still, so soft in earth and air,
    You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;
    Secure that nought of evil could delight
    To walk in such a scene, on such a night!                           
    It was a moment only for the good:
    So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,
    But turned in silence to his castle-gate;
    Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:
    Such scene reminded him of other days,
    Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,
    Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--
    No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,
    Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,
    A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.                       

                     XI.

    He turned within his solitary hall,
    And his high shadow shot along the wall:
    There were the painted forms of other times,
    'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,
    Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults
    That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;
    And half a column of the pompous page,
    That speeds the specious tale from age to age;
    Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,
    And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.                     
    He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone
    Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,
    And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there
    O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,
    Reflected in fantastic figures grew,
    Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;
    His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,
    And the wide waving of his shaken plume,
    Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave
    His aspect all that terror gives the grave.                     

                    XII.

    'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light
    Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night.
    Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--
    A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!
    A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear
    That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?
    They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,
    Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;
    They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,
    And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.                     

                    XIII.

    Cold as the marble where his length was laid,
    Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,
    Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,
    Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;
    Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,
    And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;
    Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,
    There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;
    Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,
    Some imprecation of despairing Pride;                               
    His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,
    Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,
    That oft awake his aspect could disclose,
    And now was fixed in horrible repose.
    They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,
    The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,
    His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,
    Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb
    Recalls its function, but his words are strung
    In terms that seem not of his native tongue;                        
    Distinct but strange, enough they understand
    To deem them accents of another land;
    And such they were, and meant to meet an ear
    That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!

                    XIV.

    His page approached, and he alone appeared
    To know the import of the words they heard;
    And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,
    They were not such as Lara should avow,
    Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise
    Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,                  
    But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,
    And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;
    And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem
    To soothe away the horrors of his dream--
    If dream it were, that thus could overthrow
    A breast that needed not ideal woe.

                    XV.

    Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--
    If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--
    Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,
    And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;                        
    And solace sought he none from priest nor leech,
    And soon the same in movement and in speech,
    As heretofore he filled the passing hours,
    Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,
    Than these were wont; and if the coming night
    Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,
    He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,
    Whose shuddering proved their fear was less forgot.
    In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl
    The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;                     
    The waving banner, and the clapping door,
    The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;
    The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,
    The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;
    Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,
    As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.

                    XVI.

    Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom
    Came not again, or Lara could assume
    A seeming of forgetfulness, that made
    His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.                            
    Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?
    Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord
    Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these
    That fevered moment of his mind's disease.
    Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke
    Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke
    Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart
    That ceased to beat, the look that made them start?
    Could he who thus had suffered so forget,
    When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?                        
    Or did that silence prove his memory fixed
    Too deep for words, indelible, unmixed
    In that corroding secrecy which gnaws
    The heart to show the effect, but not the cause?
    Not so in him; his breast had buried both,
    Nor common gazers could discern the growth
    Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;
    They choke the feeble words that would unfold.

                    XVII.

    In him inexplicably mixed appeared
    Much to be loved and hated, sought and feared;                      
    Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,
    In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot:
    His silence formed a theme for others' prate--
    They guessed--they gazed--they fain would know his fate.
    What had he been? what was he, thus unknown,
    Who walked their world, his lineage only known?
    A hater of his kind? yet some would say,
    With them he could seem gay amidst the gay;
    But owned that smile, if oft observed and near,
    Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;                        
    That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,
    Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:
    Yet there was softness too in his regard,
    At times, a heart as not by nature hard,
    But once perceived, his Spirit seemed to chide
    Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,
    And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem
    One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;
    In self-inflicted penance of a breast
    Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;                   
    In vigilance of Grief that would compel
    The soul to hate for having loved too well.

                    XVIII.

    There was in him a vital scorn of all:
    As if the worst had fallen which could befall,
    He stood a stranger in this breathing world,
    An erring Spirit from another hurled;
    A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped
    By choice the perils he by chance escaped;
    But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet
    His mind would half exult and half regret:                          
    With more capacity for love than Earth
    Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.
    His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,
    And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;
    With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,
    And wasted powers for better purpose lent;
    And fiery passions that had poured their wrath
    In hurried desolation o'er his path,
    And left the better feelings all at strife
    In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;                            
    But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,
    He called on Nature's self to share the shame,
    And charged all faults upon the fleshly form
    She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:
    Till he at last confounded good and ill,
    And half mistook for fate the acts of will:
    Too high for common selfishness, he could
    At times resign his own for others' good,
    But not in pity--not because he ought,
    But in some strange perversity of thought,                          
    That swayed him onward with a secret pride
    To do what few or none would do beside;
    And this same impulse would, in tempting time,
    Mislead his spirit equally to crime;
    So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,
    The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,
    And longed by good or ill to separate
    Himself from all who shared his mortal state;
    His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne
    Far from the world, in regions of her own:                          
    Thus coldly passing all that passed below,
    His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:
    Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,
    But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!
    'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,
    And like the rest in seeming did and talked,
    Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,
    His Madness was not of the head, but heart;
    And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew
    His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.                        

                    XIX.

    With all that chilling mystery of mien,
    And seeming gladness to remain unseen,
    He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art
    Of fixing memory on another's heart:
    It was not love perchance--nor hate--nor aught
    That words can image to express the thought;
    But they who saw him did not see in vain,
    And once beheld--would ask of him again:
    And those to whom he spake remembered well,
    And on the words, however light, would dwell:                       
    None knew, nor how, nor why, but he entwined
    Himself perforce around the hearer's mind;
    There he was stamped, in liking, or in hate,
    If greeted once; however brief the date
    That friendship, pity, or aversion knew,
    Still there within the inmost thought he grew.
    You could not penetrate his soul, but found,
    Despite your wonder, to your own he wound;
    His presence haunted still; and from the breast
    He forced an all unwilling interest:                                
    Vain was the struggle in that mental net--
    His Spirit seemed to dare you to forget!

                    XX.

    There is a festival, where knights and dames,
    And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,
    Appear--a high-born and a welcome guest
    To Otho's hall came Lara with the rest.
    The long carousal shakes the illumined hall,
    Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;
    And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train
    Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:                          
    Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands
    That mingle there in well according bands;
    It is a sight the careful brow might smooth,
    And make Age smile, and dream itself to youth,
    And Youth forget such hour was past on earth,
    So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!

                    XXI.

    And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,
    His brow belied him if his soul was sad;
    And his glance followed fast each fluttering fair,
    Whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:                        
    He leaned against the lofty pillar nigh,
    With folded arms and long attentive eye,
    Nor marked a glance so sternly fixed on his--
    Ill brooked high Lara scrutiny like this:
    At length he caught it--'tis a face unknown,
    But seems as searching his, and his alone;
    Prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,
    Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:
    At length encountering meets the mutual gaze
    Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;                                 
    On Lara's glance emotion gathering grew,
    As if distrusting that the stranger threw;
    Along the stranger's aspect, fixed and stern,
    Flashed more than thence the vulgar eye could learn.

                    XXII.

    "'Tis he!" the stranger cried, and those that heard
    Re-echoed fast and far the whispered word.
    "'Tis he!"--"'Tis who?" they question far and near,
    Till louder accents rung on Lara's ear;
    So widely spread, few bosoms well could brook
    The general marvel, or that single look:                            
    But Lara stirred not, changed not, the surprise
    That sprung at first to his arrested eyes
    Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised
    Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;
    And drawing nigh, exclaimed, with haughty sneer,
    "'Tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?"

                    XXIII.

    It were too much for Lara to pass by
    Such questions, so repeated fierce and high;
    With look collected, but with accent cold,
    More mildly firm than petulantly bold,                              
    He turned, and met the inquisitorial tone--
    "My name is Lara--when thine own is known,
    Doubt not my fitting answer to requite
    The unlooked for courtesy of such a knight.
    'Tis Lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?
    I shun no question, and I wear no mask."

      "Thou shunn'st no question! Ponder--is there none
    Thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?
    And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!
    At least thy memory was not given in vain.                          
    Oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt--
    Eternity forbids thee to forget."
    With slow and searching glance upon his face
    Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace
    They knew, or chose to know--with dubious look
    He deigned no answer, but his head he shook,
    And half contemptuous turned to pass away;
    But the stern stranger motioned him to stay.

      "A word!--I charge thee stay, and answer here
    To one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,                        
    But as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, Lord,
    If false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--
    But as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,
    Distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown.
    Art thou not he? whose deeds----"
                                   "Whate'er I be,
    Words wild as these, accusers like to thee,
    I list no further; those with whom they weigh
    May hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay
    The wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,
    Which thus begins so courteously and well.                          
    Let Otho cherish here his polished guest,
    To him my thanks and thoughts shall be expressed."
    And here their wondering host hath interposed--
      "Whate'er there be between you undisclosed,
    This is no time nor fitting place to mar
    The mirthful meeting with a wordy war.
    If thou, Sir Ezzelin, hast aught to show
    Which it befits Count Lara's ear to know,
    To-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best
    Beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;                        
    I pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,
    Though, like Count Lara, now returned alone
    From other lands, almost a stranger grown;
    And if from Lara's blood and gentle birth
    I augur right of courage and of worth,
    He will not that untainted line belie,
    Nor aught that Knighthood may accord, deny."

      "To-morrow be it," Ezzelin replied,
    "And here our several worth and truth be tried;
    I gage my life, my falchion to attest                               
    My words, so may I mingle with the blest!"
    What answers Lara? to its centre shrunk
    His soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;
    The words of many, and the eyes of all
    That there were gathered, seemed on him to fall;
    But his were silent, his appeared to stray
    In far forgetfulness away--away--
    Alas! that heedlessness of all around
    Bespoke remembrance only too profound.

                    XXIV.

    "To-morrow!--aye, to-morrow!" further word                      
    Than those repeated none from Lara heard;
    Upon his brow no outward passion spoke;
    From his large eye no flashing anger broke;
    Yet there was something fixed in that low tone,
    Which showed resolve, determined, though unknown.
    He seized his cloak--his head he slightly bowed,
    And passing Ezzelin, he left the crowd;
    And, as he passed him, smiling met the frown
    With which that Chieftain's brow would bear him down:
    It was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride                     
    That curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;
    But that of one in his own heart secure
    Of all that he would do, or could endure.
    Could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?
    Or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?
    Alas! too like in confidence are each,
    For man to trust to mortal look or speech;
    From deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern
    Truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn.

                    XXV.

    And Lara called his page, and went his way--                        
    Well could that stripling word or sign obey:
    His only follower from those climes afar,
    Where the Soul glows beneath a brighter star:
    For Lara left the shore from whence he sprung,
    In duty patient, and sedate though young;
    Silent as him he served, his faith appears
    Above his station, and beyond his years.
    Though not unknown the tongue of Lara's land,
    In such from him he rarely heard command;
    But fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,                 
    When Lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:
    Those accents, as his native mountains dear,
    Awake their absent echoes in his ear,
    Friends'--kindred's--parents'--wonted voice recall,
    Now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:
    For him earth now disclosed no other guide;
    What marvel then he rarely left his side?

                    XXVI.

    Light was his form, and darkly delicate
    That brow whereon his native sun had sate,
    But had not marred, though in his beams he grew,                    
    The cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;
    Yet not such blush as mounts when health would show
    All the heart's hue in that delighted glow;
    But 'twas a hectic tint of secret care
    That for a burning moment fevered there;
    And the wild sparkle of his eye seemed caught
    From high, and lightened with electric thought,
    Though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe
    Had tempered with a melancholy tinge;
    Yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,                         
    Or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:
    And pleased not him the sports that please his age,
    The tricks of Youth, the frolics of the Page;
    For hours on Lara he would fix his glance,
    As all-forgotten in that watchful trance;
    And from his chief withdrawn, he wandered lone,
    Brief were his answers, and his questions none;
    His walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;
    His resting-place the bank that curbs the brook:
    He seemed, like him he served, to live apart                        
    From all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;
    To know no brotherhood, and take from earth
    No gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth.

                    XXVII.

    If aught he loved, 'twas Lara; but was shown
    His faith in reverence and in deeds alone;
    In mute attention; and his care, which guessed
    Each wish, fulfilled it ere the tongue expressed.
    Still there was haughtiness in all he did,
    A spirit deep that brooked not to be chid;
    His zeal, though more than that of servile hands,               
    In act alone obeys, his air commands;
    As if 'twas Lara's less than his desire
    That thus he served, but surely not for hire.
    Slight were the tasks enjoined him by his Lord,
    To hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;
    To tune his lute, or, if he willed it more,
    On tomes of other times and tongues to pore;
    But ne'er to mingle with the menial train,
    To whom he showed nor deference nor disdain,
    But that well-worn reserve which proved he knew                     
    No sympathy with that familiar crew:
    His soul, whate'er his station or his stem,
    Could bow to Lara, not descend to them.
    Of higher birth he seemed, and better days,
    Nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,
    So femininely white it might bespeak
    Another sex, when matched with that smooth cheek,
    But for his garb, and something in his gaze,
    More wild and high than Woman's eye betrays;
    A latent fierceness that far more became                            
    His fiery climate than his tender frame:
    True, in his words it broke not from his breast,
    But from his aspect might be more than guessed.
    Kaled his name, though rumour said he bore
    Another ere he left his mountain-shore;
    For sometimes he would hear, however nigh,
    That name repeated loud without reply,
    As unfamiliar--or, if roused again,
    Start to the sound, as but remembered then;
    Unless 'twas Lara's wonted voice that spake,                        
    For then--ear--eyes--and heart would all awake.

                    XXVIII.

    He had looked down upon the festive hall,
    And mark'd that sudden strife so marked of all:
    And when the crowd around and near him told
    Their wonder at the calmness of the bold,
    Their marvel how the high-born Lara bore
    Such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,
    The colour of young Kaled went and came,
    The lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;
    And o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw                   
    The sickening iciness of that cold dew,
    That rises as the busy bosom sinks
    With heavy thoughts from which Reflection shrinks.
    Yes--there be things which we must dream and dare,
    And execute ere thought be half aware:
    Whate'er might Kaled's be, it was enow
    To seal his lip, but agonise his brow.
    He gazed on Ezzelin till Lara cast
    That sidelong smile upon the knight he past;
    When Kaled saw that smile his visage fell,                          
    As if on something recognised right well:
    His memory read in such a meaning more
    Than Lara's aspect unto others wore:
    Forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,
    And all within that hall seemed left alone;
    Each had so fixed his eye on Lara's mien,
    All had so mixed their feelings with that scene,
    That when his long dark shadow through the porch
    No more relieves the glare of yon high torch,
    Each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem                       
    To bound as doubting from too black a dream,
    Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,
    Because the worst is ever nearest truth.
    And they are gone--but Ezzelin is there,
    With thoughtful visage and imperious air;
    But long remained not; ere an hour expired
    He waved his hand to Otho, and retired.

                    XXIX.

    The crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;
    The courteous host, and all-approving guest,
    Again to that accustomed couch must creep                           
    Where Joy subsides, and Sorrow sighs to sleep,
    And Man, o'erlaboured with his Being's strife,
    Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:
    There lie Love's feverish hope, and Cunning's guile,
    Hate's working brain, and lulled Ambition's wile;
    O'er each vain eye Oblivion's pinions wave,
    And quenched Existence crouches in a grave.
    What better name may Slumber's bed become?
    Night's sepulchre, the universal home,
    Where Weakness--Strength--Vice--Virtue--sunk supine,                
    Alike in naked helplessness recline;
    Glad for a while to heave unconscious breath,
    Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of Death,
    And shun--though Day but dawn on ills increased--
    That sleep,--the loveliest, since it dreams the least.



                     CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    Night wanes--the vapours round the mountains curled
    Melt into morn, and Light awakes the world,
    Man has another day to swell the past,
    And lead him near to little, but his last;
    But mighty Nature bounds as from her birth,                         
    The Sun is in the heavens, and Life on earth;
    Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,
    Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.
    Immortal Man! behold her glories shine,
    And cry, exulting inly, "They are thine!"
    Gaze on, while yet thy gladdened eye may see:
    A morrow comes when they are not for thee:
    And grieve what may above thy senseless bier,
    Nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;
    Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,                   
    Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;
    But creeping things shall revel in their spoil,
    And fit thy clay to fertilise the soil.

                    II.

    'Tis morn--'tis noon--assembled in the hall,
    The gathered Chieftains come to Otho's call;
    'Tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim
    The life or death of Lara's future fame;
    And Ezzelin his charge may here unfold,
    And whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told.
    His faith was pledged, and Lara's promise given,                    
    To meet it in the eye of Man and Heaven.
    Why comes he not? Such truths to be divulged,
    Methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged.

                    III.

    The hour is past, and Lara too is there,
    With self-confiding, coldly patient air;
    Why comes not Ezzelin? The hour is past,
    And murmurs rise, and Otho's brow's o'ercast.
    "I know my friend! his faith I cannot fear,
    If yet he be on earth, expect him here;
    The roof that held him in the valley stands                         
    Between my own and noble Lara's lands;
    My halls from such a guest had honour gained,
    Nor had Sir Ezzelin his host disdained,
    But that some previous proof forbade his stay,
    And urged him to prepare against to-day;
    The word I pledged for his I pledge again,
    Or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain."
    He ceased--and Lara answered, "I am here
    To lend at thy demand a listening ear
    To tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,                          
    Whose words already might my heart have wrung,
    But that I deemed him scarcely less than mad,
    Or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad.
    I know him not--but me it seems he knew
    In lands where--but I must not trifle too:
    Produce this babbler--or redeem the pledge;
    Here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge."

    Proud Otho on the instant, reddening, threw
    His glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew.
    "The last alternative befits me best,                               
    And thus I answer for mine absent guest."

    With cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,
    However near his own or other's tomb;
    With hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke
    Its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;
    With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,
    Did Lara too his willing weapon bare.
    In vain the circling Chieftains round them closed,
    For Otho's frenzy would not be opposed;
    And from his lip those words of insult fell--                       
    His sword is good who can maintain them well.

                    IV.

    Short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,
    Vain Otho gave his bosom to the gash:
    He bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,
    Stretched by a dextrous sleight along the ground.
    "Demand thy life!" He answered not: and then
    From that red floor he ne'er had risen again,
    For Lara's brow upon the moment grew
    Almost to blackness in its demon hue;
    And fiercer shook his angry falchion now                            
    Than when his foe's was levelled at his brow;
    Then all was stern collectedness and art,
    Now rose the unleavened hatred of his heart;
    So little sparing to the foe he felled,
    That when the approaching crowd his arm withheld,
    He almost turned the thirsty point on those
    Who thus for mercy dared to interpose;
    But to a moment's thought that purpose bent;
    Yet looked he on him still with eye intent,
    As if he loathed the ineffectual strife                             
    That left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;
    As if to search how far the wound he gave
    Had sent its victim onward to his grave.

                    V.

    They raised the bleeding Otho, and the Leech
    Forbade all present question, sign, and speech;
    The others met within a neighbouring hall,
    And he, incensed, and heedless of them all,
    The cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,
    In haughty silence slowly strode away;
    He backed his steed, his homeward path he took,                     
    Nor cast on Otho's towers a single look.

                    VI.

    But where was he? that meteor of a night,
    Who menaced but to disappear with light.
    Where was this Ezzelin? who came and went,
    To leave no other trace of his intent.
    He left the dome of Otho long ere morn,
    In darkness, yet so well the path was worn
    He could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;
    But there he was not, and with coming day
    Came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought,                           
    Except the absence of the Chief it sought.
    A chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,
    His host alarmed, his murmuring squires distressed:
    Their search extends along, around the path,
    In dread to meet the marks of prowlers' wrath:
    But none are there, and not a brake hath borne
    Nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;
    Nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,
    Which still retains a mark where Murder was;
    Nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,                         
    The bitter print of each convulsive nail,
    When agonis?d hands that cease to guard,
    Wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward.
    Some such had been, if here a life was reft,
    But these were not; and doubting Hope is left;
    And strange Suspicion, whispering Lara's name,
    Now daily mutters o'er his blackened fame;
    Then sudden silent when his form appeared,
    Awaits the absence of the thing it feared
    Again its wonted wondering to renew,                                
    And dye conjecture with a darker hue.

                    VII.

    Days roll along, and Otho's wounds are healed,
    But not his pride; and hate no more concealed:
    He was a man of power, and Lara's foe,
    The friend of all who sought to work him woe,
    And from his country's justice now demands
    Account of Ezzelin at Lara's hands.
    Who else than Lara could have cause to fear
    His presence? who had made him disappear,
    If not the man on whom his menaced charge                           
    Had sate too deeply were he left at large?
    The general rumour ignorantly loud,
    The mystery dearest to the curious crowd;
    The seeming friendliness of him who strove
    To win no confidence, and wake no love;
    The sweeping fierceness which his soul betrayed,
    The skill with which he wielded his keen blade;
    Where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?
    Where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?
    For it was not the blind capricious rage                        
    A word can kindle and a word assuage;
    But the deep working of a soul unmixed
    With aught of pity where its wrath had fixed;
    Such as long power and overgorged success
    Concentrates into all that's merciless:
    These, linked with that desire which ever sways
    Mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,
    'Gainst Lara gathering raised at length a storm,
    Such as himself might fear, and foes would form,
    And he must answer for the absent head                              
    Of one that haunts him still, alive or dead.

                    VIII.

    Within that land was many a malcontent,
    Who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;
    That soil full many a wringing despot saw,
    Who worked his wantonness in form of law;
    Long war without and frequent broil within
    Had made a path for blood and giant sin,
    That waited but a signal to begin
    New havoc, such as civil discord blends,
    Which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;                    
    Fixed in his feudal fortress each was lord,
    In word and deed obeyed, in soul abhorred.
    Thus Lara had inherited his lands,
    And with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;
    But that long absence from his native clime
    Had left him stainless of Oppression's crime,
    And now, diverted by his milder sway,
    All dread by slow degrees had worn away.
    The menials felt their usual awe alone,
    But more for him than them that fear was grown;                     
    They deemed him now unhappy, though at first
    Their evil judgment augured of the worst,
    And each long restless night, and silent mood,
    Was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:
    And though his lonely habits threw of late
    Gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;
    For thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,
    For them, at least, his soul compassion knew.
    Cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,
    The humble passed not his unheeding eye;                            
    Much he would speak not, but beneath his roof
    They found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof.
    And they who watched might mark that, day by day,
    Some new retainers gathered to his sway;
    But most of late, since Ezzelin was lost,
    He played the courteous lord and bounteous host:
    Perchance his strife with Otho made him dread
    Some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;
    Whate'er his view, his favour more obtains
    With these, the people, than his fellow thanes.                     
    If this were policy, so far 'twas sound,
    The million judged but of him as they found;
    From him by sterner chiefs to exile driven
    They but required a shelter, and 'twas given.
    By him no peasant mourned his rifled cot,
    And scarce the Serf could murmur o'er his lot;
    With him old Avarice found its hoard secure,
    With him contempt forbore to mock the poor;
    Youth present cheer and promised recompense
    Detained, till all too late to part from thence:                    
    To Hate he offered, with the coming change,
    The deep reversion of delayed revenge;
    To Love, long baffled by the unequal match,
    The well-won charms success was sure to snatch.
    All now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim
    That slavery nothing which was still a name.
    The moment came, the hour when Otho thought
    Secure at last the vengeance which he sought:
    His summons found the destined criminal
    Begirt by thousands in his swarming hall;                           
    Fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,
    Defying earth, and confident of heaven.
    That morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves,
    Who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!
    Such is their cry--some watchword for the fight
    Must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;
    Religion--Freedom--Vengeance--what you will,
    A word's enough to raise Mankind to kill;
    Some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,
    That Guilt may reign-and wolves and worms be fed!                   

                    IX.

    Throughout that clime the feudal Chiefs had gained
    Such sway, their infant monarch hardly reigned;
    Now was the hour for Faction's rebel growth,
    The Serfs contemned the one, and hated both:
    They waited but a leader, and they found
    One to their cause inseparably bound;
    By circumstance compelled to plunge again,
    In self-defence, amidst the strife of men.
    Cut off by some mysterious fate from those
    Whom Birth and Nature meant not for his foes,                       
    Had Lara from that night, to him accurst,
    Prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:
    Some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun
    Inquiry into deeds at distance done;
    By mingling with his own the cause of all,
    E'en if he failed, he still delayed his fall.
    The sullen calm that long his bosom kept,
    The storm that once had spent itself and slept,
    Roused by events that seemed foredoomed to urge
    His gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,                          
    Burst forth, and made him all he once had been,
    And is again; he only changed the scene.
    Light care had he for life, and less for fame,
    But not less fitted for the desperate game:
    He deemed himself marked out for others' hate,
    And mocked at Ruin so they shared his fate.
    And cared he for the freedom of the crowd?
    He raised the humble but to bend the proud.
    He had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,
    But Man and Destiny beset him there:                                
    Inured to hunters, he was found at bay;
    And they must kill, they cannot snare the prey.
    Stern, unambitious, silent, he had been
    Henceforth a calm spectator of Life's scene;
    But dragged again upon the arena, stood
    A leader not unequal to the feud;
    In voice--mien--gesture--savage nature spoke,
    And from his eye the gladiator broke.

                    X.

    What boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,
    The feast of vultures, and the waste of life?                       
    The varying fortune of each separate field,
    The fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?
    The smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?
    In this the struggle was the same with all;
    Save that distempered passions lent their force
    In bitterness that banished all remorse.
    None sued, for Mercy knew her cry was vain,
    The captive died upon the battle-plain:
    In either cause, one rage alone possessed
    The empire of the alternate victor's breast;                        
    And they that smote for freedom or for sway,
    Deemed few were slain, while more remained to slay.
    It was too late to check the wasting brand,
    And Desolation reaped the famished land;
    The torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,
    And Carnage smiled upon her daily dead.

                    XI.

    Fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,
    The first success to Lara's numbers clung:
    But that vain victory hath ruined all;
    They form no longer to their leader's call:                         
    In blind confusion on the foe they press,
    And think to snatch is to secure success.
    The lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,
    Lure on the broken brigands to their fate:
    In vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,
    To check the headlong fury of that crew;
    In vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,
    The hand that kindles cannot quench the flame;
    The wary foe alone hath turned their mood,
    And shown their rashness to that erring brood:                      
    The feigned retreat, the nightly ambuscade,
    The daily harass, and the fight delayed,
    The long privation of the hoped supply,
    The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,
    The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,
    And palls the patience of his baffled art,
    Of these they had not deemed: the battle-day
    They could encounter as a veteran may;
    But more preferred the fury of the strife,
    And present death, to hourly suffering life:                        
    And Famine wrings, and Fever sweeps away
    His numbers melting fast from their array;
    Intemperate triumph fades to discontent,
    And Lara's soul alone seems still unbent;
    But few remain to aid his voice and hand,
    And thousands dwindled to a scanty band:
    Desperate, though few, the last and best remained
    To mourn the discipline they late disdained.
    One hope survives, the frontier is not far,
    And thence they may escape from native war:                         
    And bear within them to the neighbouring state
    An exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:
    Hard is the task their father-land to quit,
    But harder still to perish or submit.

                    XII.

    It is resolved--they march--consenting Night
    Guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;
    Already they perceive its tranquil beam
    Sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;
    Already they descry--Is yon the bank?
    Away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank.                          
    Return or fly!--What glitters in the rear?
    'Tis Otho's banner--the pursuer's spear!
    Are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?
    Alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:
    Cut off from hope, and compassed in the toil,
    Less blood perchance hath bought a richer spoil!

                    XIII.

    A moment's pause--'tis but to breathe their band,
    Or shall they onward press, or here withstand?
    It matters little--if they charge the foes
    Who by their border-stream their march oppose,                      
    Some few, perchance, may break and pass the line,
    However linked to baffle such design.
    "The charge be ours! to wait for their assault
    Were fate well worthy of a coward's halt."
    Forth flies each sabre, reined is every steed,
    And the next word shall scarce outstrip the deed:
    In the next tone of Lara's gathering breath
    How many shall but hear the voice of Death!

                    XIV.

    His blade is bared,--in him there is an air
    As deep, but far too tranquil for despair;                          
    A something of indifference more than then
    Becomes the bravest, if they feel for men--
    He turned his eye on Kaled, ever near,
    And still too faithful to betray one fear;
    Perchance 'twas but the moon's dim twilight threw
    Along his aspect an unwonted hue
    Of mournful paleness, whose deep tint expressed
    The truth, and not the terror of his breast.
    This Lara marked, and laid his hand on his:
    It trembled not in such an hour as this;                           
    His lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,
    His eye alone proclaimed, "We will not part!
    Thy band may perish, or thy friends may flee,
    Farewell to Life--but not Adieu to thee!"

    The word hath passed his lips, and onward driven,
    Pours the linked band through ranks asunder riven:
    Well has each steed obeyed the arm?d heel,
    And flash the scimitars, and rings the steel;
    Outnumbered, not outbraved, they still oppose
    Despair to daring, and a front to foes;                            
    And blood is mingled with the dashing stream,
    Which runs all redly till the morning beam.

                    XV.

    Commanding--aiding--animating all,
    Where foe appeared to press, or friend to fall,
    Cheers Lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,
    Inspiring hope, himself had ceased to feel.
    None fled, for well they knew that flight were vain;
    But those that waver turn to smite again,
    While yet they find the firmest of the foe
    Recoil before their leader's look and blow:                        
    Now girt with numbers, now almost alone,
    He foils their ranks, or re-unites his own;
    Himself he spared not--once they seemed to fly--
    Now was the time, he waved his hand on high,
    And shook--Why sudden droops that plum?d crest?
    The shaft is sped--the arrow's in his breast!
    That fatal gesture left the unguarded side,
    And Death has stricken down yon arm of pride.
    The word of triumph fainted from his tongue;
    That hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!                      
    But yet the sword instinctively retains,
    Though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;
    These Kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,
    And senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow,
    Perceives not Lara that his anxious page
    Beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:
    Meantime his followers charge, and charge again;
    Too mixed the slayers now to heed the slain!

                    XVI.

    Day glimmers on the dying and the dead,
    The cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;                         
    The war-horse masterless is on the earth,
    And that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth;
    And near, yet quivering with what life remained,
    The heel that urged him and the hand that reined;
    And some too near that rolling torrent lie,
    Whose waters mock the lip of those that die;
    That panting thirst which scorches in the breath
    Of those that die the soldier's fiery death,
    In vain impels the burning mouth to crave
    One drop--the last--to cool it for the grave;                      
    With feeble and convulsive effort swept,
    Their limbs along the crimsoned turf have crept;
    The faint remains of life such struggles waste,
    But yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:
    They feel its freshness, and almost partake--
    Why pause? No further thirst have they to slake--
    It is unquenched, and yet they feel it not;
    It was an agony--but now forgot!

                    XVII.

    Beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,
    Where but for him that strife had never been,                      
    A breathing but devoted warrior lay:
    'Twas Lara bleeding fast from life away.
    His follower once, and now his only guide,
    Kneels Kaled watchful o'er his welling side,
    And with his scarf would staunch the tides that rush,
    With each convulsion, in a blacker gush;
    And then, as his faint breathing waxes low,
    In feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:
    He scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,
    And merely adds another throb to pain.                             
    He clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,
    And sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,
    Who nothing fears--nor feels--nor heeds--nor sees--
    Save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;
    Save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,
    Held all the light that shone on earth for him.

                    XVIII.

    The foe arrives, who long had searched the field,
    Their triumph nought till Lara too should yield:
    They would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,
    And he regards them with a calm disdain,                           
    That rose to reconcile him with his fate,
    And that escape to death from living hate:
    And Otho comes, and leaping from his steed,
    Looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,
    And questions of his state; he answers not,
    Scarce glances on him as on one forgot,
    And turns to Kaled:--each remaining word
    They understood not, if distinctly heard;
    His dying tones are in that other tongue,
    To which some strange remembrance wildly clung.                    
    They spake of other scenes, but what--is known
    To Kaled, whom their meaning reached alone;
    And he replied, though faintly, to their sound,
    While gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:
    They seemed even then--that twain--unto the last
    To half forget the present in the past;
    To share between themselves some separate fate,
    Whose darkness none beside should penetrate.

                    XIX.

    Their words though faint were many--from the tone
    Their import those who heard could judge alone;                    
    From this, you might have deemed young Kaled's death
    More near than Lara's by his voice and breath,
    So sad--so deep--and hesitating broke
    The accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;
    But Lara's voice, though low, at first was clear
    And calm, till murmuring Death gasped hoarsely near;
    But from his visage little could we guess,
    So unrepentant--dark--and passionless,
    Save that when struggling nearer to his last,
    Upon that page his eye was kindly cast;                            
    And once, as Kaled's answering accents ceased,
    Rose Lara's hand, and pointed to the East:
    Whether (as then the breaking Sun from high
    Rolled back the clouds) the morrow caught his eye,
    Or that 'twas chance--or some remembered scene,
    That raised his arm to point where such had been,
    Scarce Kaled seemed to know, but turned away,
    As if his heart abhorred that coming day,
    And shrunk his glance before that morning light,
    To look on Lara's brow--where all grew night.                      
    Yet sense seemed left, though better were its loss;
    For when one near displayed the absolving Cross,
    And proffered to his touch the holy bead,
    Of which his parting soul might own the need,
    He looked upon it with an eye profane,
    And smiled--Heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain:
    And Kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew
    From Lara's face his fixed despairing view,
    With brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,
    Flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,                    
    As if such but disturbed the expiring man,
    Nor seemed to know his life but then began--
    That Life of Immortality, secure
    To none, save them whose faith in Christ is sure.

                    XX.

    But gasping heaved the breath that Lara drew,
    And dull the film along his dim eye grew;
    His limbs stretched fluttering, and his head drooped o'er
    The weak yet still untiring knee that bore;
    He pressed the hand he held upon his heart--
    It beats no more, but Kaled will not part                          
    With the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,
    For that faint throb which answers not again.
    "It beats!"--Away, thou dreamer! he is gone--
    It once was Lara which thou look'st upon.

                    XXI.

    He gazed, as if not yet had passed away
    The haughty spirit of that humbled clay;
    And those around have roused him from his trance,
    But cannot tear from thence his fix?d glance;
    And when, in raising him from where he bore
    Within his arms the form that felt no more,                        
    He saw the head his breast would still sustain,
    Roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;
    He did not dash himself thereby, nor tear
    The glossy tendrils of his raven hair,
    But strove to stand and gaze, but reeled and fell,
    Scarce breathing more than that he loved so well.
    Than that he loved! Oh! never yet beneath
    The breast of man such trusty love may breathe!
    That trying moment hath at once revealed
    The secret long and yet but half concealed;                        
    In baring to revive that lifeless breast,
    Its grief seemed ended, but the sex confessed;
    And life returned, and Kaled felt no shame--
    What now to her was Womanhood or Fame?

                    XXII.

    And Lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,
    But where he died his grave was dug as deep;
    Nor is his mortal slumber less profound,
    Though priest nor blessed nor marble decked the mound,
    And he was mourned by one whose quiet grief,
    Less loud, outlasts a people's for their Chief.                    
    Vain was all question asked her of the past,
    And vain e'en menace--silent to the last;
    She told nor whence, nor why she left behind
    Her all for one who seemed but little kind.
    Why did she love him? Curious fool!--be still--
    Is human love the growth of human will?
    To her he might be gentleness; the stern
    Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,
    And when they love, your smilers guess not how
    Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.                 
    They were not common links, that formed the chain
    That bound to Lara Kaled's heart and brain;
    But that wild tale she brooked not to unfold,
    And sealed is now each lip that could have told.

                    XXIII.

    They laid him in the earth, and on his breast,
    Besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,
    They found the scattered dints of many a scar,
    Which were not planted there in recent war;
    Where'er had passed his summer years of life,
    It seems they vanished in a land of strife;                        
    But all unknown his Glory or his Guilt,
    These only told that somewhere blood was spilt,
    And Ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,
    Returned no more--that night appeared his last.

                    XXIV.

    Upon that night (a peasant's is the tale)
    A Serf that crossed the intervening vale,
    When Cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,
    And nearly veiled in mist her waning horn;
    A Serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,
    And hew the bough that bought his children's food,                 
    Passed by the river that divides the plain
    Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:
    He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke
    From out the wood--before him was a cloak
    Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,
    Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.
    Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,
    And some foreboding that it might be crime,
    Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,
    Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,                     
    And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,
    Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,
    Then paused--and looked--and turned--and seemed to watch,
    And still another hurried glance would snatch,
    And follow with his step the stream that flowed,
    As if even yet too much its surface showed;
    At once he started--stooped--around him strown
    The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:
    Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,
    And slung them with a more than common care.                       
    Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen
    Himself might safely mark what this might mean;
    He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,
    And something glittered starlike on the vest;
    But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,
    A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:
    It rose again, but indistinct to view,
    And left the waters of a purple hue,
    Then deeply disappeared: the horseman gazed
    Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;                          
    Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,
    And instant spurred him into panting speed.
    His face was masked--the features of the dead,
    If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;
    But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,
    Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,
    And such 'tis known Sir Ezzelin had worn
    Upon the night that led to such a morn.
    If thus he perished, Heaven receive his soul!
    His undiscovered limbs to ocean roll;                              
    And charity upon the hope would dwell
    It was not Lara's hand by which he fell.

                    XXV.

    And Kaled--Lara--Ezzelin, are gone,
    Alike without their monumental stone!
    The first, all efforts vainly strove to wean
    From lingering where her Chieftain's blood had been:
    Grief had so tamed a spirit once too proud,
    Her tears were few, her wailing never loud;
    But furious would you tear her from the spot
    Where yet she scarce believed that he was not,                     
    Her eye shot forth with all the living fire
    That haunts the tigress in her whelpless ire;
    But left to waste her weary moments there,
    She talked all idly unto shapes of air,
    Such as the busy brain of Sorrow paints,
    And woos to listen to her fond complaints:
    And she would sit beneath the very tree
    Where lay his drooping head upon her knee;
    And in that posture where she saw him fall,
    His words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;                      
    And she had shorn, but saved her raven hair,
    And oft would snatch it from her bosom there,
    And fold, and press it gently to the ground,
    As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.
    Herself would question, and for him reply;
    Then rising, start, and beckon him to fly
    From some imagined Spectre in pursuit;
    Then seat her down upon some linden's root,
    And hide her visage with her meagre hand,
    Or trace strange characters along the sand--                       
    This could not last--she lies by him she loved;
    Her tale untold--her truth too dearly proved.





                             HEBREW MELODIES



                 SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.

                    I.

    She walks in Beauty, like the night
      Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    And all that's best of dark and bright
      Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
    Thus mellowed to that tender light
      Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.

                    II.

    One shade the more, one ray the less,
      Had half impaired the nameless grace
    Which waves in every raven tress,
      Or softly lightens o'er her face;
    Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
     How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

                    III.

    And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
      So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
    The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
      But tell of days in goodness spent,
    A mind at peace with all below,
      A heart whose love is innocent!

                                                          June 12, 1814.



            THE HARP THE MONARCH MINSTREL SWEPT.

                    I.

      The Harp the Monarch Minstrel swept,
        The King of men, the loved of Heaven!
      Which Music hallowed while she wept
        O'er tones her heart of hearts had given--
    Redoubled be her tears, its chords are riven!
      It softened men of iron mould,
        It gave them virtues not their own;
      No ear so dull, no soul so cold,
        That felt not--fired not to the tone,
    Till David's Lyre grew mightier than his Throne!

                    II.

      It told the triumphs of our King,
        It wafted glory to our God;
      It made our gladdened valleys ring,
        The cedars bow, the mountains nod;
    Its sound aspired to Heaven and there abode!
      Since then, though heard on earth no more,
        Devotion and her daughter Love
      Still bid the bursting spirit soar
        To sounds that seem as from above,
    In dreams that day's broad light can not remove.



                    IF THAT HIGH WORLD.

                    I.

    If that high world, which lies beyond
      Our own, surviving Love endears;
    If there the cherished heart be fond,
      The eye the same, except in tears--
    How welcome those untrodden spheres!
      How sweet this very hour to die!
    To soar from earth and find all fears
      Lost in thy light--Eternity!

                    II.

    It must be so: 'tis not for self
      That we so tremble on the brink;
    And striving to o'erleap the gulf,
      Yet cling to Being's severing link.
    Oh! in that future let us think
      To hold each heart the heart that shares,
    With them the immortal waters drink,
      And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!



                     THE WILD GAZELLE.

                    I.

    The wild gazelle on Judah's hills
      Exulting yet may bound,
    And drink from all the living rills
      That gush on holy ground;
    Its airy step and glorious eye
    May glance in tameless transport by:--

                    II.

    A step as fleet, an eye more bright,
      Hath Judah witnessed there;
    And o'er her scenes of lost delight
      Inhabitants more fair.
    The cedars wave on Lebanon,
    But Judah's statelier maids are gone!

                    III.

      Than Israel's scattered race;
    For, taking root, it there remains
      In solitary grace:
    It cannot quit its place of birth,
    It will not live in other earth.

                    IV.

    But we must wander witheringly,
      In other lands to die;
    And where our fathers' ashes be,
      Our own may never lie:
    Our temple hath not left a stone,
    And Mockery sits on Salem's throne.



                    OH! WEEP FOR THOSE.

                    I.

    Oh! weep for those that wept by Babel's stream,
    Whose shrines are desolate, whose land a dream;
    Weep for the harp of Judah's broken shell;
    Mourn--where their God hath dwelt the godless dwell!

                    II.

    And where shall Israel lave her bleeding feet?
    And when shall Zion's songs again seem sweet?
    And Judah's melody once more rejoice
    The hearts that leaped before its heavenly voice?

                    III.

    Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast,
    How shall ye flee away and be at rest!
    The wild-dove hath her nest, the fox his cave,
    Mankind their country--Israel but the grave!



                     ON JORDAN'S BANKS.

                    I.

    On Jordan's banks the Arab's camels stray,
    On Sion's hill the False One's votaries pray,
    The Baal-adorer bows on Sinai's steep--
    Yet there--even there--Oh God! thy thunders sleep:

                    II.

    There--where thy finger scorched the tablet stone!
    There--where thy shadow to thy people shone!
    Thy glory shrouded in its garb of fire:
    Thyself--none living see and not expire!

                    III.

    Oh! in the lightning let thy glance appear;
    Sweep from his shivered hand the oppressor's spear!
    How long by tyrants shall thy land be trod?
    How long thy temple worshipless, Oh God?



                  JEPHTHA'S DAUGHTER.

                    I.

    Since our Country, our God--Oh, my Sire!
    Demand that thy Daughter expire;
    Since thy triumph was bought by thy vow--
    Strike the bosom that's bared for thee now!

                    II.

    And the voice of my mourning is o'er,
    And the mountains behold me no more:
    If the hand that I love lay me low,
    There cannot be pain in the blow!

                    III.

    And of this, oh, my Father! be sure--
    That the blood of thy child is as pure
    As the blessing I beg ere it flow,
    And the last thought that soothes me below.

                    IV.

    Though the virgins of Salem lament,
    Be the judge and the hero unbent!
    I have won the great battle for thee,
    And my Father and Country are free!

                    V.

    When this blood of thy giving hath gushed,
    When the voice that thou lovest is hushed,
    Let my memory still be thy pride,
    And forget not I smiled as I died!



         OH! SNATCHED AWAY IN BEAUTY'S BLOOM.

                    I.

      Oh! snatched away in beauty's bloom,
      On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;
        But on thy turf shall roses rear
        Their leaves, the earliest of the year;
    And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:

                    II.

      And oft by yon blue gushing stream
        Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,
      And feed deep thought with many a dream,
        And lingering pause and lightly tread;
    Fond wretch! as if her step disturbed the dead!

                    III.

    Away! we know that tears are vain,
      That Death nor heeds nor hears distress:
    Will this unteach us to complain?
      Or make one mourner weep the less?
    And thou--who tell'st me to forget,
    Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.

                            



                      MY SOUL IS DARK.

                    I.

    My soul is dark--Oh! quickly string
      The harp I yet can brook to hear;
    And let thy gentle fingers fling
      Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
    If in this heart a hope be dear,
      That sound shall charm it forth again:
    If in these eyes there lurk a tear,
      'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.

                    II.

    But bid the strain be wild and deep,
      Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
    I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
      Or else this heavy heart will burst;
    For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
      And ached in sleepless silence long;
    And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
      And break at once--or yield to song.



                      I SAW THEE WEEP.

                    I.

    I saw thee weep--the big bright tear
      Came o'er that eye of blue;
    And then methought it did appear
      A violet dropping dew:
    I saw thee smile--the sapphire's blaze
      Beside thee ceased to shine;
    It could not match the living rays
      That filled that glance of thine.

                    II.

    As clouds from yonder sun receive
      A deep and mellow dye,
    Which scarce the shade of coming eve
      Can banish from the sky,
    Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
      Their own pure joy impart;
    Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
      That lightens o'er the heart.



                     THY DAYS ARE DONE.

                    I.

    Thy days are done, thy fame begun;
      Thy country's strains record
    The triumphs of her chosen Son,
      The slaughters of his sword!
    The deeds he did, the fields he won,
      The freedom he restored!

                    II.

    Though thou art fall'n, while we are free
      Thou shall not taste of death!
    The generous blood that flowed from thee
      Disdained to sink beneath:
    Within our veins its currents be,
      Thy spirit on our breath!

                    III.

    Thy name, our charging hosts along,
      Shall be the battle-word!
    Thy fall, the theme of choral song
      From virgin voices poured!
    To weep would do thy glory wrong:
      Thou shalt not be deplored.



                           SAUL.

                    I.

        Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
          Bid the Prophet's form appear.
        "Samuel, raise thy buried head!
          King, behold the phantom Seer!"
    Earth yawned; he stood the centre of a cloud:
    Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
    Death stood all glassy in his fix?d eye;
    His hand was withered, and his veins were dry;
    His foot, in bony whiteness, glittered there,
    Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;
    From lips that moved not and unbreathing frame,
    Like caverned winds, the hollow accents came.
    Saul saw, and fell to earth, as falls the oak,
    At once, and blasted by the thunder-stroke.

                    II.

          "Why is my sleep disquieted?
          Who is he that calls the dead?
          Is it thou, O King? Behold,
          Bloodless are these limbs, and cold:
          Such are mine; and such shall be
          Thine to-morrow, when with me:
          Ere the coming day is done,
          Such shalt thou be--such thy Son.
          Fare thee well, but for a day,
          Then we mix our mouldering clay.
          Thou--thy race, lie pale and low,
          Pierced by shafts of many a bow;
          And the falchion by thy side
          To thy heart thy hand shall guide:
          Crownless--breathless--headless fall,
          Son and Sire--the house of Saul!"

                                                     Seaham, Feb., 1815.



            SONG OF SAUL BEFORE HIS LAST BATTLE.

                    I.

    Warriors and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword
    Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,
    Heed not the corse, though a King's, in your path:
    Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!

                    II.

    Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow,
    Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,
    Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet!
    Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet.

                    III.

    Farewell to others, but never we part,
    Heir to my Royalty--Son of my heart!
    Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,
    Or kingly the death, which awaits us to-day!

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



             "ALL IS VANITY, SAITH THE PREACHER"

                    I.

        Fame, Wisdom, Love, and Power were mine,
          And Health and Youth possessed me;
        My goblets blushed from every vine,
          And lovely forms caressed me;
        I sunned my heart in Beauty's eyes,
          And felt my soul grow tender;
        All Earth can give, or mortal prize,
          Was mine of regal splendour.

                    II.

        I strive to number o'er what days
          Remembrance can discover,
        Which all that Life or Earth displays
          Would lure me to live over.
        There rose no day, there rolled no hour
          Of pleasure unembittered;
        And not a trapping decked my Power
          That galled not while it glittered.

                    III.

        The serpent of the field, by art
          And spells, is won from harming;
        But that which coils around the heart,
          Oh! who hath power of charming?
        It will not list to Wisdom's lore,
          Nor Music's voice can lure it;
        But there it stings for evermore
          The soul that must endure it.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



          WHEN COLDNESS WRAPS THIS SUFFERING CLAY.

                    I.

    When coldness wraps this suffering clay,
      Ah! whither strays the immortal mind?
    It cannot die, it cannot stay,
      But leaves its darkened dust behind.
    Then, unembodied, doth it trace
      By steps each planet's heavenly way?
    Or fill at once the realms of space,
      A thing of eyes, that all survey?

                    II.

    Eternal--boundless,--undecayed,
      A thought unseen, but seeing all,
    All, all in earth, or skies displayed,
      Shall it survey, shall it recall:
    Each fainter trace that Memory holds
      So darkly of departed years,
    In one broad glance the Soul beholds,
      And all, that was, at once appears.

                    III.

    Before Creation peopled earth,
      Its eye shall roll through chaos back;
    And where the farthest heaven had birth,
      The Spirit trace its rising track.
    And where the future mars or makes,
      Its glance dilate o'er all to be,
    While Sun is quenched--or System breaks,
      Fixed in its own Eternity.

                    IV.

    Above or Love--Hope--Hate--or Fear,
      It lives all passionless and pure:
    An age shall fleet like earthly year;
      Its years as moments shall endure.
    Away--away--without a wing,
      O'er all--through all--its thought shall fly,
    A nameless and eternal thing,
      Forgetting what it was to die.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



                 VISION OF BELSHAZZAR.

                    I.

    The King was on his throne,
      The Satraps thronged the hall:
    A thousand bright lamps shone
      O'er that high festival.
    A thousand cups of gold,
      In Judah deemed divine--
    Jehovah's vessels hold
      The godless Heathen's wine!

                    II.

    In that same hour and hall,
      The fingers of a hand
    Came forth against the wall,
      And wrote as if on sand:
    The fingers of a man;--
      A solitary hand
    Along the letters ran,
      And traced them like a wand.

                    III.

    The monarch saw, and shook,
      And bade no more rejoice;
    All bloodless waxed his look,
      And tremulous his voice.
    "Let the men of lore appear,
      The wisest of the earth,
    And expound the words of fear,
      Which mar our royal mirth."

                    IV.

    Chaldea's seers are good,
      But here they have no skill;
    And the unknown letters stood
      Untold and awful still.
    And Babel's men of age
      Are wise and deep in lore;
    But now they were not sage,
      They saw--but knew no more.

                    V.

    A captive in the land,
      A stranger and a youth,
    He heard the King's command,
      He saw that writing's truth.
    The lamps around were bright,
      The prophecy in view;
    He read it on that night,--
      The morrow proved it true.

                    VI.

    "Belshazzar's grave is made,
      His kingdom passed away.
    He, in the balance weighed,
      Is light and worthless clay;
    The shroud, his robe of state,
      His canopy the stone;
    The Mede is at his gate!
      The Persian on his throne!"



                   SUN OF THE SLEEPLESS!

    Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
    Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
    That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
    How like art thou to Joy remembered well!
    So gleams the past, the light of other days,
    Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays:
    A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
    Distinct, but distant--clear--but, oh how cold!



      WERE MY BOSOM AS FALSE AS THOU DEEM'ST IT TO BE.

                    I.

    Were my bosom as false as thou deem'st it to be,
    I need not have wandered from far Galilee;
    It was but abjuring my creed to efface
    The curse which, thou say'st, is the crime of my race.

                    II.

    If the bad never triumph, then God is with thee!
    If the slave only sin--thou art spotless and free!
    If the Exile on earth is an Outcast on high,
    Live on in thy faith--but in mine I will die.

                    III.

    I have lost for that faith more than thou canst bestow,
    As the God who permits thee to prosper doth know;
    In his hand is my heart and my hope--and in thine
    The land and the life which for him I resign.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



             HEROD'S LAMENT FOR MARIAMNE.

                    I.

    Oh, Mariamne! now for thee
      The heart for which thou bled'st is bleeding;
    Revenge is lost in Agony
      And wild Remorse to rage succeeding.
    Oh, Mariamne! where art thou?
      Thou canst not hear my bitter pleading:
    Ah! could'st thou--thou would'st pardon now,
      Though Heaven were to my prayer unheeding.

                    II.

    And is she dead?--and did they dare
      Obey my Frenzy's jealous raving?
    My Wrath but doomed my own despair:
      The sword that smote her 's o'er me waving.--
    But thou art cold, my murdered Love!
      And this dark heart is vainly craving
    For he who soars alone above,
      And leaves my soul unworthy saving.

                    III.

    She's gone, who shared my diadem;
      She sunk, with her my joys entombing;
    I swept that flower from Judah's stem,
      Whose leaves for me alone were blooming;
    And mine's the guilt, and mine the hell,
      This bosom's desolation dooming;
    And I have earned those tortures well,
      Which unconsumed are still consuming!

                                                          Jan. 15, 1815.



    ON THE DAY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM BY TITUS.

                    I.

    From the last hill that looks on thy once holy dome,
    I beheld thee, oh Sion! when rendered to Rome:
    'Twas thy last sun went down, and the flames of thy fall
    Flashed back on the last glance I gave to thy wall.

                    II.

    I looked for thy temple--I looked for my home,
    And forgot for a moment my bondage to come;
    I beheld but the death-fire that fed on thy fane,
    And the fast-fettered hands that made vengeance in vain.

                    III.

    On many an eve, the high spot whence I gazed
    Had reflected the last beam of day as it blazed;
    While I stood on the height, and beheld the decline
    Of the rays from the mountain that shone on thy shrine.

                    IV.

    And now on that mountain I stood on that day,
    But I marked not the twilight beam melting away;
    Oh! would that the lightning had glared in its stead,
    And the thunderbolt burst on the Conqueror's head!

                    V.

    But the Gods of the Pagan shall never profane
    The shrine where Jehovah disdained not to reign;
    And scattered and scorned as thy people may be,
    Our worship, oh Father! is only for thee.

                                                                     1815.



    BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON WE SAT DOWN AND WEPT.

                    I.

    We sate down and wept by the waters
      Of Babel, and thought of the day
    When our foe, in the hue of his slaughters,
      Made Salem's high places his prey;
    And Ye, oh her desolate daughters!
      Were scattered all weeping away.

                    II.

    While sadly we gazed on the river
      Which rolled on in freedom below,
    They demanded the song; but, oh never
      That triumph the Stranger shall know!
    May this right hand be withered for ever,
      Ere it string our high harp for the foe!

                    III.

    On the willow that harp is suspended,
      Oh Salem! its sound should be free;
    And the hour when thy glories were ended
      But left me that token of thee:
    And ne'er shall its soft tones be blended
      With the voice of the Spoiler by me!

                                                         Jan. 15, 1813.



                "BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON."

                    I.

    In the valley of waters we wept on the day
    When the host of the Stranger made Salem his prey;
    And our heads on our bosoms all droopingly lay,
    And our hearts were so full of the land far away!

                    II.

    The song they demanded in vain--it lay still
    In our souls as the wind that hath died on the hill--
    They called for the harp--but our blood they shall spill
    Ere our right hands shall teach them one tone of their skill.

                    III.

    All stringlessly hung in the willow's sad tree,
    As dead as her dead-leaf, those mute harps must be:
    Our hands may be fettered--our tears still are free
    For our God--and our Glory--and Sion, Oh Thee!

                                                                     1815.



              THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB.

                    I.

    The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
    And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
    And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
    When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

                    II.

    Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
    That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
    Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
    That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

                    III.

    For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
    And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
    And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
    And their hearts but once heaved--and for ever grew still!

                    IV.

    And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
    But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
    And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
    And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

                    V.

    And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
    With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
    And the tents were all silent--the banners alone--
    The lances unlifted--the trumpet unblown.

                    VI.

    And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
    And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
    And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
    Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!

                                                    Seaham, Feb. 17, 1815.



                 A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE ME.

                         FROM JOB.

                    I.

    A spirit passed before me: I beheld
    The face of Immortality unveiled--
    Deep Sleep came down on every eye save mine--
    And there it stood,--all formless--but divine:
    Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
    And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake:

                    II.

    "Is man more just than God? Is man more pure
    Than he who deems even Seraphs insecure?
    Creatures of clay--vain dwellers in the dust!
    The moth survives you, and are ye more just?
    Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
    Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!"




                             POEMS 1814-1816.



             FAREWELL! IF EVER FONDEST PRAYER.

                    1.

    Farewell! if ever fondest prayer
      For other's weal availed on high,
    Mine will not all be lost in air,
      But waft thy name beyond the sky.
    'Twere vain to speak--to weep--to sigh:
      Oh! more than tears of blood can tell,
    When wrung from Guilt's expiring eye,
      Are in that word--Farewell!--Farewell!

                    2.

    These lips are mute, these eyes are dry;
      But in my breast and in my brain,
    Awake the pangs that pass not by,
      The thought that ne'er shall sleep again.
    My soul nor deigns nor dares complain,
      Though Grief and Passion there rebel:
    I only know we loved in vain--
      I only feel--Farewell!--Farewell!

                       



                    WHEN WE TWO PARTED.

                    1.

    When we two parted
      In silence and tears,
    Half broken-hearted
      To sever for years,
    Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
      Colder thy kiss;
    Truly that hour foretold
      Sorrow to this.

                    2.

    The dew of the morning
      Sunk chill on my brow--
    It felt like the warning
      Of what I feel now.
    Thy vows are all broken,
      And light is thy fame:
    I hear thy name spoken,
      And share in its shame.

                    3.

    They name thee before me,
      A knell to mine ear;
    A shudder comes o'er me--
      Why wert thou so dear?
    They know not I knew thee,
      Who knew thee too well:--
    Long, long shall I rue thee,
      Too deeply to tell.

                    4.

    In secret we met--
      In silence I grieve.
    That thy heart could forget,
      Thy spirit deceive.
    If I should meet thee
      After long years,
    How should I greet thee?--
      With silence and tears.

                                         



                   

                    1.

    I cannot talk of Love to thee,
      Though thou art young and free and fair!
    There is a spell thou dost not see,
      That bids a genuine love despair.

                    2.

    And yet that spell invites each youth,
      For thee to sigh, or seem to sigh;
    Makes falsehood wear the garb of truth,
      And Truth itself appear a lie.

                    3.

    If ever Doubt a place possest
      In woman's heart, 'twere wise in thine:
    Admit not Love into thy breast,
      Doubt others' love, nor trust in mine.

                    4.

    Perchance 'tis feigned, perchance sincere,
      But false or true thou canst not tell;
    So much hast thou from all to fear,
      In that unconquerable spell.

                    5.

    Of all the herd that throng around,
      Thy simpering or thy sighing train,
    Come tell me who to thee is bound
      By Love's or Plutus' heavier chain.

                    6.

    In some 'tis Nature, some 'tis Art
      That bids them worship at thy shrine;
    But thou deserv'st a better heart,
      Than they or I can give for thine.

                    7.

    For thee, and such as thee, behold,
      Is Fortune painted truly--blind!
    Who doomed thee to be bought or sold,
      Has proved too bounteous to be kind.

                    8.

    Each day some tempter's crafty suit
      Would woo thee to a loveless bed:
    I see thee to the altar's foot
      A decorated victim led.

                    9.

    Adieu, dear maid! I must not speak
      Whate'er my secret thoughts may be;
    Though thou art all that man can reck
      I dare not talk of Love to thee.

                    1.

    I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,
    There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame:
    But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart
    The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.

                    2.

    Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace,
    Were those hours--can their joy or their bitterness cease?
    We repent, we abjure, we will break from our chain,--
    We will part, we will fly to--unite it again!

                    3.

    Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt!
    Forgive me, adored one!--forsake, if thou wilt;--
    But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased
    And man shall not break it--whatever thou mayst.

                    4.

    And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
    This soul, in its bitterest blackness, shall be:
    And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
    With thee by my side, than with worlds at our feet.

                    5.

    One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,
    Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove;
    And the heartless may wonder at all I resign--
    Thy lip shall reply, not to them, but to mine.

                                                            May 4, 1814.
                  



             ADDRESS INTENDED TO BE RECITED AT
                THE CALEDONIAN MEETING.

    Who hath not glowed above the page where Fame
    Hath fixed high Caledon's unconquered name;
    The mountain-land which spurned the Roman chain,
    And baffled back the fiery-crested Dane,
    Whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand
    No foe could tame--no tyrant could command?
    That race is gone--but still their children breathe,
    And Glory crowns them with redoubled wreath:
    O'er Gael and Saxon mingling banners shine,
    And, England! add their stubborn strength to thine.
    The blood which flowed with Wallace flows as free,
    But now 'tis only shed for Fame and thee!
    Oh! pass not by the northern veteran's claim,
    But give support--the world hath given him fame!

    The humbler ranks, the lowly brave, who bled
    While cheerly following where the Mighty led--
    Who sleep beneath the undistinguished sod
    Where happier comrades in their triumph trod,
    To us bequeath--'tis all their fate allows--
    The sireless offspring and the lonely spouse:
    She on high Albyn's dusky hills may raise
    The tearful eye in melancholy gaze,
    Or view, while shadowy auguries disclose
    The Highland Seer's anticipated woes,
    The bleeding phantom of each martial form
    Dim in the cloud, or darkling in the storm;
    While sad, she chaunts the solitary song,
    The soft lament for him who tarries long--
    For him, whose distant relics vainly crave
    The Coronach's wild requiem to the brave!

    'Tis Heaven--not man--must charm away the woe,
    Which bursts when Nature's feelings newly flow;
    Yet Tenderness and Time may rob the tear
    Of half its bitterness for one so dear;
    A Nation's gratitude perchance may spread
    A thornless pillow for the widowed head;
    May lighten well her heart's maternal care,
    And wean from Penury the soldier's heir;
    Or deem to living war-worn Valour just
    Each wounded remnant--Albion's cherished trust--
    Warm his decline with those endearing rays,
    Whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days--
    So shall that Country--while he sinks to rest--
    His hand hath fought for--by his heart be blest!

                                                              May, 1814.
                  



              ELEGIAC STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF
                SIR PETER PARKER, BART.

                    1.

    There is a tear for all that die,
      A mourner o'er the humblest grave;
    But nations swell the funeral cry,
      And Triumph weeps above the brave.

                    2.

    For them is Sorrow's purest sigh
      O'er Ocean's heaving bosom sent:
    In vain their bones unburied lie,
      All earth becomes their monument!

                    3.

    A tomb is theirs on every page,
      An epitaph on every tongue:
    The present hours, the future age,
      For them bewail, to them belong.

                    4.

    For them the voice of festal mirth
      Grows hushed, their name the only sound;
    While deep Remembrance pours to Worth
      The goblet's tributary round.

                    5.

    A theme to crowds that knew them not,
      Lamented by admiring foes,
    Who would not share their glorious lot?
      Who would not die the death they chose?

                    6.

    And, gallant Parker! thus enshrined
      Thy life, thy fall, thy fame shall be;
    And early valour, glowing, find
      A model in thy memory.

                    7.

    But there are breasts that bleed with thee
      In woe, that glory cannot quell;
    And shuddering hear of victory,
      Where one so dear, so dauntless, fell.

                    8.

    Where shall they turn to mourn thee less?
      When cease to hear thy cherished name?
    Time cannot teach forgetfulness,
      While Grief's full heart is fed by Fame.

                    9.

    Alas! for them, though not for thee,
      They cannot choose but weep the more;
    Deep for the dead the grief must be,
      Who ne'er gave cause to mourn before.

                                                        October 7, 1814.
                  



                 JULIAN .

                    1.

    The Night came on the Waters--all was rest
    On Earth--but Rage on Ocean's troubled Heart.
    The Waves arose and rolled beneath the blast;
    The Sailors gazed upon their shivered Mast.
    In that dark Hour a long loud gathered cry
    From out the billows pierced the sable sky,
    And borne o'er breakers reached the craggy shore--
    The Sea roars on--that Cry is heard no more.

                    2.

    There is no vestige, in the Dawning light,
    Of those that shrieked thro' shadows of the Night.
    The Bark--the Crew--the very Wreck is gone,
    Marred--mutilated--traceless--all save one.
    In him there still is Life, the Wave that dashed
    On shore the plank to which his form was lashed,
    Returned unheeding of its helpless Prey--
    The lone survivor of that Yesterday--
    The one of Many whom the withering Gale
    Hath left unpunished to record their Tale.
    But who shall hear it? on that barren Sand
    None comes to stretch the hospitable hand.
    That shore reveals no print of human foot,
    Nor e'en the pawing of the wilder Brute;
    And niggard vegetation will not smile,
    All sunless on that solitary Isle.

                    3.

    The naked Stranger rose, and wrung his hair,
    And that first moment passed in silent prayer.
    Alas! the sound--he sunk into Despair--
    He was on Earth--but what was Earth to him,
    Houseless and homeless--bare both breast and limb?
    Cut off from all but Memory he curst
    His fate--his folly--but himself the worst.
    What was his hope? he looked upon the Wave--
    Despite--of all--it still may be his Grave!

                    4.

    He rose and with a feeble effort shaped
    His course unto the billows--late escaped:
    But weakness conquered--swam his dizzy glance,
    And down to Earth he sunk in silent trance.
    How long his senses bore its chilling chain,
    He knew not--but, recalled to Life again,
    A stranger stood beside his shivering form--
    And what was he? had he too scaped the storm?

                    5.

    He raised young Julian. "Is thy Cup so full
    Of bitterness--thy Hope--thy heart so dull
    That thou shouldst from Thee dash the Draught of Life,
    So late escaped the elemental strife!
    Rise--tho' these shores few aids to Life supply,
    Look upon me, and know thou shalt not die.
    Thou gazest in mute wonder--more may be
    Thy marvel when thou knowest mine and me.
    But come--The bark that bears us hence shall find
    Her Haven, soon, despite the warning Wind."

                    6.

    He raised young Julian from the sand, and such
    Strange power of healing dwelt within the touch,
    That his weak limbs grew light with freshened Power,
    As he had slept not fainted in that hour,
    And woke from Slumber--as the Birds awake,
    Recalled at morning from the branch?d brake,
    When the day's promise heralds early Spring,
    And Heaven unfolded woos their soaring wing:
    So Julian felt, and gazed upon his Guide,
    With honest Wonder what might next betide.

                                                            Dec. 12, 1814.



                       TO BELSHAZZAR.

                    1.

    Belshazzar! from the banquet turn,
      Nor in thy sensual fulness fall;
    Behold! while yet before thee burn
      The graven words, the glowing wall,
    Many a despot men miscall
      Crowned and anointed from on high;
    But thou, the weakest, worst of all--
      Is it not written, thou must die?

                    2.

    Go! dash the roses from thy brow--
      Grey hairs but poorly wreathe with them;
    Youth's garlands misbecome thee now,
      More than thy very diadem,
    Where thou hast tarnished every gem:--
      Then throw the worthless bauble by,
    Which, worn by thee, ev'n slaves contemn;
      And learn like better men to die!

                    3.

    Oh! early in the balance weighed,
      And ever light of word and worth,
    Whose soul expired ere youth decayed,
      And left thee but a mass of earth.
    To see thee moves the scorner's mirth:
      But tears in Hope's averted eye
    Lament that even thou hadst birth--
      Unfit to govern, live, or die.

                                                      February 12, 1815.

    "O Lachrymarum fons, tenero sacros
      Ducentium ortus ex animo: quater
        Felix! in imo qui scatentem
           Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit."
                                                        Gray's Poemata.
                     

                    1.

    There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away,
    When the glow of early thought declines in Feeling's dull decay;
    'Tis not on Youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades
                                                        so fast,
    But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere Youth itself be past.

                    2.

    Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
    Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess:
    The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain
    The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.

                    3.

    Then the mortal coldness of the soul like Death itself comes down;
    It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own;
    That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,
    And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears.

                    4.

    Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,
    Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest;
    'Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreath
    All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and grey beneath.

                    5.

    Oh, could I feel as I have felt,--or be what I have been,
    Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished scene;
    As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
    So, midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me.

                                                            March, 1815.
                                         



          ON THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF DORSET.

                    1.

    I heard thy fate without a tear,
      Thy loss with scarce a sigh;
    And yet thou wast surpassing dear,
      Too loved of all to die.
    I know not what hath seared my eye--
      Its tears refuse to start;
    But every drop, it bids me dry,
      Falls dreary on my heart.

                    2.

    Yes, dull and heavy, one by one,
      They sink and turn to care,
    As caverned waters wear the stone,
      Yet dropping harden there:
    They cannot petrify more fast,
      Than feelings sunk remain,
    Which coldly fixed regard the past,
      But never melt again.

                    1.

    Bright be the place of thy soul!
      No lovelier spirit than thine
    E'er burst from its mortal control,
      In the orbs of the blessed to shine.
    On earth thou wert all but divine,
      As thy soul shall immortally be;
    And our sorrow may cease to repine
      When we know that thy God is with thee.

                    2.

    Light be the turf of thy tomb!
      May its verdure like emeralds be!
    There should not be the shadow of gloom
      In aught that reminds us of thee.
    Young flowers and an evergreen tree
      May spring from the spot of thy rest:
    But nor cypress nor yew let us see;
      For why should we mourn for the blest?

                              



                 NAPOLEON'S FAREWELL.

                     

                    1.

    Farewell to the Land, where the gloom of my Glory
    Arose and o'ershadowed the earth with her name--
    She abandons me now--but the page of her story,
    The brightest or blackest, is filled with my fame.
    I have warred with a World which vanquished me only
    When the meteor of conquest allured me too far;
    I have coped with the nations which dread me thus lonely,
    The last single Captive to millions in war.

                    2.

    Farewell to thee, France! when thy diadem crowned me,
    I made thee the gem and the wonder of earth,--
    But thy weakness decrees I should leave as I found thee,
    Decayed in thy glory, and sunk in thy worth.
    Oh! for the veteran hearts that were wasted
    In strife with the storm, when their battles were won--
    Then the Eagle, whose gaze in that moment was blasted
    Had still soared with eyes fixed on Victory's sun!

                    3.

    Farewell to thee, France!--but when Liberty rallies
    Once more in thy regions, remember me then,--
    The Violet still grows in the depth of thy valleys;
    Though withered, thy tear will unfold it again--
    Yet, yet, I may baffle the hosts that surround us,
    And yet may thy heart leap awake to my voice--
    There are links which must break in the chain that has bound us,
    Then turn thee and call on the Chief of thy choice!

                                                  July 25, 1815. London.
                             



                   FROM THE FRENCH.

                    I.

    Must thou go, my glorious Chief,
      Severed from thy faithful few?
    Who can tell thy warrior's grief,
      Maddening o'er that long adieu?
    Woman's love, and Friendship's zeal,
      Dear as both have been to me--
    What are they to all I feel,
      With a soldier's faith for thee?

                    II.

    Idol of the soldier's soul!
      First in fight, but mightiest now;
    Many could a world control;
      Thee alone no doom can bow.
    By thy side for years I dared
      Death; and envied those who fell,
    When their dying shout was heard,
      Blessing him they served so well.

                    III.

    Would that I were cold with those,
      Since this hour I live to see;
    When the doubts of coward foes
      Scarce dare trust a man with thee,
    Dreading each should set thee free!
      Oh! although in dungeons pent,
    All their chains were light to me,
      Gazing on thy soul unbent.

                    IV.

    Would the sycophants of him
      Now so deaf to duty's prayer,
    Were his borrowed glories dim,
      In his native darkness share?
    Were that world this hour his own,
      All thou calmly dost resign,
    Could he purchase with that throne
      Hearts like those which still are thine?

                    V.

    My Chief, my King, my Friend, adieu!
      Never did I droop before;
    Never to my Sovereign sue,
      As his foes I now implore:
    All I ask is to divide
      Every peril he must brave;
    Sharing by the hero's side
      His fall--his exile--and his grave.

                                        



                 ODE FROM THE FRENCH.

                    I.

    We do not curse thee, Waterloo!
    Though Freedom's blood thy plain bedew;
    There 'twas shed, but is not sunk--
    Rising from each gory trunk,
    Like the water-spout from ocean,
    With a strong and growing motion--
    It soars, and mingles in the air,
    With that of lost La B?doy?re--
    With that of him whose honoured grave
    Contains the "bravest of the brave."
    A crimson cloud it spreads and glows,
    But shall return to whence it rose;
    When 'tis full 'twill burst asunder--
    Never yet was heard such thunder
    As then shall shake the world with wonder--
    Never yet was seen such lightning
    As o'er heaven shall then be bright'ning!
    Like the Wormwood Star foretold
      By the sainted Seer of old,
    Show'ring down a fiery flood,
    Turning rivers into blood.

                    II.

    The Chief has fallen, but not by you,
    Vanquishers of Waterloo!
    When the soldier citizen
    Swayed not o'er his fellow-men--
    Save in deeds that led them on
    Where Glory smiled on Freedom's son--
    Who, of all the despots banded,
      With that youthful chief competed?
      Who could boast o'er France defeated,
    Till lone Tyranny commanded?
    Till, goaded by Ambition's sting,
    The Hero sunk into the King?
    Then he fell:--so perish all,
    Who would men by man enthral!

                    III.

    And thou, too, of the snow-white plume!
    Whose realm refused thee ev'n a tomb;
    Better hadst thou still been leading
    France o'er hosts of hirelings bleeding,
    Than sold thyself to death and shame
    For a meanly royal name;
    Such as he of Naples wears,
    Who thy blood-bought title bears.
    Little didst thou deem, when dashing
      On thy war-horse through the ranks.
      Like a stream which burst its banks,
    While helmets cleft, and sabres clashing,
    Shone and shivered fast around thee--
    Of the fate at last which found thee:
    Was that haughty plume laid low
    By a slave's dishonest blow?
    Once--as the Moon sways o'er the tide,
    It rolled in air, the warrior's guide;
    Through the smoke-created night
    Of the black and sulphurous fight,
    The soldier raised his seeking eye
    To catch that crest's ascendancy,--
    And, as it onward rolling rose,
    So moved his heart upon our foes.
    There, where death's brief pang was quickest,
    And the battle's wreck lay thickest,
    Strewed beneath the advancing banner
      Of the eagle's burning crest--
    (There with thunder-clouds to fan her,
      Who could then her wing arrest--
      Victory beaming from her breast?)
    While the broken line enlarging
      Fell, or fled along the plain;
    There be sure was Murat charging!
      There he ne'er shall charge again!

                    IV.

    O'er glories gone the invaders march,
    Weeps Triumph o'er each levelled arch--
    But let Freedom rejoice,
    With her heart in her voice;
    But, her hand on her sword,
    Doubly shall she be adored;
    France hath twice too well been taught
    The "moral lesson" dearly bought--
    Her safety sits not on a throne,
    With Capet or Napoleon!
    But in equal rights and laws,
    Hearts and hands in one great cause--
    Freedom, such as God hath given
    Unto all beneath his heaven,
    With their breath, and from their birth,
    Though guilt would sweep it from the earth;
    With a fierce and lavish hand
    Scattering nations' wealth like sand;
    Pouring nations' blood like water,
    In imperial seas of slaughter!

                    V.

    But the heart and the mind,
    And the voice of mankind,
    Shall arise in communion--
    And who shall resist that proud union?
    The time is past when swords subdued--
    Man may die--the soul's renewed:
    Even in this low world of care
    Freedom ne'er shall want an heir;
    Millions breathe but to inherit
    Her for ever bounding spirit--
    When once more her hosts assemble,
    Tyrants shall believe and tremble--
    Smile they at this idle threat?
    Crimson tears will follow yet.

    There be none of Beauty's daughters
      With a magic like thee;
    And like music on the waters
      Is thy sweet voice to me:
    When, as if its sound were causing
    The charm?d Ocean's pausing,
    The waves lie still and gleaming,
    And the lulled winds seem dreaming:

                    2.

    And the midnight Moon is weaving
      Her bright chain o'er the deep;
    Whose breast is gently heaving,
      As an infant's asleep:
    So the spirit bows before thee,
    To listen and adore thee;
    With a full but soft emotion,
    Like the swell of Summer's ocean.

        ON THE STAR OF "THE LEGION OF HONOUR."

                     

                    1.

    Star of the brave!--whose beam hath shed
    Such glory o'er the quick and dead--
    Thou radiant and adored deceit!
    Which millions rushed in arms to greet,--
    Wild meteor of immortal birth!
    Why rise in Heaven to set on Earth?

                    2.

    Souls of slain heroes formed thy rays;
    Eternity flashed through thy blaze;
    The music of thy martial sphere
    Was fame on high and honour here;
    And thy light broke on human eyes,
    Like a Volcano of the skies.

                    3.

    Like lava rolled thy stream of blood,
    And swept down empires with its flood;
    Earth rocked beneath thee to her base,
    As thou didst lighten through all space;
    And the shorn Sun grew dim in air,
    And set while thou wert dwelling there.

                    4.

    Before thee rose, and with thee grew,
    A rainbow of the loveliest hue
    Of three bright colours, each divine,
    And fit for that celestial sign;
    For Freedom's hand had blended them,
    Like tints in an immortal gem.

                    5.

    One tint was of the sunbeam's dyes;
    One, the blue depth of Seraph's eyes;
    One, the pure Spirit's veil of white
    Had robed in radiance of its light:
    The three so mingled did beseem
    The texture of a heavenly dream.

                    6.

    Star of the brave! thy ray is pale,
    And darkness must again prevail!
    But, oh thou Rainbow of the free!
    Our tears and blood must flow for thee.
    When thy bright promise fades away,
    Our life is but a load of clay.

                    7.

    And Freedom hallows with her tread
    The silent cities of the dead;
    For beautiful in death are they
    Who proudly fall in her array;
    And soon, oh, Goddess! may we be
    For evermore with them or thee!

    They say that Hope is happiness;
      But genuine Love must prize the past,
    And Memory wakes the thoughts that bless:
      They rose the first--they set the last;

                    II.

    And all that Memory loves the most
      Was once our only Hope to be,
    And all that Hope adored and lost
      Hath melted into Memory.

                    III.

    Alas! it is delusion all:
      The future cheats us from afar,
    Nor can we be what we recall,
      Nor dare we think on what we are.

                               






                    THE SIEGE OF CORINTH

    In the year since Jesus died for men,
    Eighteen hundred years and ten,
    We were a gallant company,
    Riding o'er land, and sailing o'er sea.
    Oh! but we went merrily!
    We forded the river, and clomb the high hill,
    Never our steeds for a day stood still;
    Whether we lay in the cave or the shed,
    Our sleep fell soft on the hardest bed;
    Whether we couched in our rough capote,                         
    On the rougher plank of our gliding boat,
    Or stretched on the beach, or our saddles spread,
    As a pillow beneath the resting head,
    Fresh we woke upon the morrow:
      All our thoughts and words had scope,
      We had health, and we had hope,
    Toil and travel, but no sorrow.
    We were of all tongues and creeds;--
    Some were those who counted beads,
    Some of mosque, and some of church,                                  
      And some, or I mis-say, of neither;
    Yet through the wide world might ye search,
      Nor find a motlier crew nor blither.

    But some are dead, and some are gone,
    And some are scattered and alone,
    And some are rebels on the hills
      That look along Epirus' valleys,
      Where Freedom still at moments rallies,
    And pays in blood Oppression's ills;
      And some are in a far countree,                                    
    And some all restlessly at home;
      But never more, oh! never, we
    Shall meet to revel and to roam.
    But those hardy days flew cheerily!
    And when they now fall drearily,
    My thoughts, like swallows, skim the main,
    And bear my spirit back again
    Over the earth, and through the air,
    A wild bird and a wanderer.
    'Tis this that ever wakes my strain,                                 
    And oft, too oft, implores again
    The few who may endure my lay,
    To follow me so far away.
    Stranger, wilt thou follow now,
    And sit with me on Acro-Corinth's brow?

                    I.

    Many a vanished year and age,
    And Tempest's breath, and Battle's rage,
    Have swept o'er Corinth; yet she stands,
    A fortress formed to Freedom's hands.
    The Whirlwind's wrath, the Earthquake's shock,                       
    Have left untouched her hoary rock,
    The keystone of a land, which still,
    Though fall'n, looks proudly on that hill,
    The landmark to the double tide
    That purpling rolls on either side,
    As if their waters chafed to meet,
    Yet pause and crouch beneath her feet.
    But could the blood before her shed
    Since first Timoleon's brother bled,
    Or baffled Persia's despot fled,                                     
    Arise from out the Earth which drank
    The stream of Slaughter as it sank,
    That sanguine Ocean would o'erflow
    Her isthmus idly spread below:
    Or could the bones of all the slain,
    Who perished there, be piled again,
    That rival pyramid would rise
    More mountain-like, through those clear skies
    Than yon tower-capp'd Acropolis,
    Which seems the very clouds to kiss.                                 

                    II.

    On dun Cith?ron's ridge appears
    The gleam of twice ten thousand spears;
    And downward to the Isthmian plain,
    From shore to shore of either main,
    The tent is pitched, the Crescent shines
    Along the Moslem's leaguering lines;
    And the dusk Spahi's bands advance
    Beneath each bearded Pacha's glance;
    And far and wide as eye can reach
    The turbaned cohorts throng the beach;                               
    And there the Arab's camel kneels,
    And there his steed the Tartar wheels;
    The Turcoman hath left his herd,
    The sabre round his loins to gird;
    And there the volleying thunders pour,
    Till waves grow smoother to the roar.
    The trench is dug, the cannon's breath
    Wings the far hissing globe of death;
    Fast whirl the fragments from the wall,
    Which crumbles with the ponderous ball;                              
    And from that wall the foe replies,
    O'er dusty plain and smoky skies,
    With fares that answer fast and well
    The summons of the Infidel.

                    III.

    But near and nearest to the wall
    Of those who wish and work its fall,
    With deeper skill in War's black art,
    Than Othman's sons, and high of heart
    As any Chief that ever stood
    Triumphant in the fields of blood;                                  
    From post to post, and deed to deed,
    Fast spurring on his reeking steed,
    Where sallying ranks the trench assail,
    And make the foremost Moslem quail;
    Or where the battery, guarded well,
    Remains as yet impregnable,
    Alighting cheerly to inspire
    The soldier slackening in his fire;
    The first and freshest of the host
    Which Stamboul's Sultan there can boast,                            
    To guide the follower o'er the field,
    To point the tube, the lance to wield,
    Or whirl around the bickering blade;--
    Was Alp, the Adrian renegade!

                    IV.

    From Venice--once a race of worth
    His gentle Sires--he drew his birth;
    But late an exile from her shore,
    Against his countrymen he bore
    The arms they taught to bear; and now
    The turban girt his shaven brow.                                    
    Through many a change had Corinth passed
    With Greece to Venice' rule at last;
    And here, before her walls, with those
    To Greece and Venice equal foes,
    He stood a foe, with all the zeal
    Which young and fiery converts feel,
    Within whose heated bosom throngs
    The memory of a thousand wrongs.
    To him had Venice ceased to be
    Her ancient civic boast--"the Free;"                                
    And in the palace of St. Mark
    Unnamed accusers in the dark
    Within the "Lion's mouth" had placed
    A charge against him uneffaced:
    He fled in time, and saved his life,
    To waste his future years in strife,
    That taught his land how great her loss
    In him who triumphed o'er the Cross,
    'Gainst which he reared the Crescent high,
    And battled to avenge or die.                                       

                    V.

    Coumourgi--he whose closing scene
    Adorned the triumph of Eugene,
    When on Carlowitz' bloody plain,
    The last and mightiest of the slain,
    He sank, regretting not to die,
    But cursed the Christian's victory--
    Coumourgi--can his glory cease,
    That latest conqueror of Greece,
    Till Christian hands to Greece restore
    The freedom Venice gave of yore?                                    
    A hundred years have rolled away
    Since he refixed the Moslem's sway;
    And now he led the Mussulman,
    And gave the guidance of the van
    To Alp, who well repaid the trust
    By cities levelled with the dust;
    And proved, by many a deed of death,
    How firm his heart in novel faith.

                    VI.

    The walls grew weak; and fast and hot
    Against them poured the ceaseless shot,                             
    With unabating fury sent
    From battery to battlement;
    And thunder-like the pealing din
    Rose from each heated culverin;
    And here and there some crackling dome
    Was fired before the exploding bomb;
    And as the fabric sank beneath
    The shattering shell's volcanic breath,
    In red and wreathing columns flashed
    The flame, as loud the ruin crashed,                                
    Or into countless meteors driven,
    Its earth-stars melted into heaven;
    Whose clouds that day grew doubly dun,
    Impervious to the hidden sun,
    With volumed smoke that slowly grew
    To one wide sky of sulphurous hue.

                    VII.

    But not for vengeance, long delayed,
    Alone, did Alp, the renegade,
    The Moslem warriors sternly teach
    His skill to pierce the promised breach:                            
    Within these walls a Maid was pent
    His hope would win, without consent
    Of that inexorable Sire,
    Whose heart refused him in its ire,
    When Alp, beneath his Christian name,
    Her virgin hand aspired to claim.
    In happier mood, and earlier time,
    While unimpeached for traitorous crime,
    Gayest in Gondola or Hall,
    He glittered through the Carnival;                                  
    And tuned the softest serenade
    That e'er on Adria's waters played
    At midnight to Italian maid.

                    VIII.

    And many deemed her heart was won;
    For sought by numbers, given to none,
    Had young Francesca's hand remained
    Still by the Church's bonds unchained:
    And when the Adriatic bore
    Lanciotto to the Paynim shore,
    Her wonted smiles were seen to fail,                                
    And pensive waxed the maid and pale;
    More constant at confessional,
    More rare at masque and festival;
    Or seen at such, with downcast eyes,
    Which conquered hearts they ceased to prize:
    With listless look she seems to gaze:
    With humbler care her form arrays;
    Her voice less lively in the song;
    Her step, though light, less fleet among
    The pairs, on whom the Morning's glance                             
    Breaks, yet unsated with the dance.

                    IX.

    Sent by the State to guard the land,
    (Which, wrested from the Moslem's hand,
    While Sobieski tamed his pride
    By Buda's wall and Danube's side,
    The chiefs of Venice wrung away
    From Patra to Euboea's bay,)
    Minotti held in Corinth's towers
    The Doge's delegated powers,
    While yet the pitying eye of Peace                                  
    Smiled o'er her long forgotten Greece:
    And ere that faithless truce was broke
    Which freed her from the unchristian yoke,
    With him his gentle daughter came;
    Nor there, since Menelaus' dame
    Forsook her lord and land, to prove
    What woes await on lawless love,
    Had fairer form adorned the shore
    Than she, the matchless stranger, bore.

                    X.

    The wall is rent, the ruins yawn;                                   
    And, with to-morrow's earliest dawn,
    O'er the disjointed mass shall vault
    The foremost of the fierce assault.
    The bands are ranked--the chosen van
    Of Tartar and of Mussulman,
    The full of hope, misnamed "forlorn,"
    Who hold the thought of death in scorn,
    And win their way with falchion's force,
    Or pave the path with many a corse,
    O'er which the following brave may rise,                            
    Their stepping-stone--the last who dies!

                    XI.

    'Tis midnight: on the mountains brown
    The cold, round moon shines deeply down;
    Blue roll the waters, blue the sky
    Spreads like an ocean hung on high,
    Bespangled with those isles of light,
    So wildly, spiritually bright;
    Who ever gazed upon them shining
    And turned to earth without repining,
    Nor wished for wings to flee away,                                  
    And mix with their eternal ray?
    The waves on either shore lay there
    Calm, clear, and azure as the air;
    And scarce their foam the pebbles shook,
    But murmured meekly as the brook.
    The winds were pillowed on the waves;
    The banners drooped along their staves,
    And, as they fell around them furling,
    Above them shone the crescent curling;
    And that deep silence was unbroke,                                  
    Save where the watch his signal spoke,
    Save where the steed neighed oft and shrill,
    And echo answered from the hill,
    And the wide hum of that wild host
    Rustled like leaves from coast to coast,
    As rose the Muezzin's voice in air
    In midnight call to wonted prayer;
    It rose, that chanted mournful strain,
    Like some lone Spirit's o'er the plain:
    'Twas musical, but sadly sweet,                                     
    Such as when winds and harp-strings meet,
    And take a long unmeasured tone,
    To mortal minstrelsy unknown.
    It seemed to those within the wall
    A cry prophetic of their fall:
    It struck even the besieger's ear
    With something ominous and drear,
    An undefined and sudden thrill,
    Which makes the heart a moment still,
    Then beat with quicker pulse, ashamed                               
    Of that strange sense its silence framed;
    Such as a sudden passing-bell
    Wakes, though but for a stranger's knell.

                    XII.

    The tent of Alp was on the shore;
    The sound was hushed, the prayer was o'er;
    The watch was set, the night-round made,
    All mandates issued and obeyed:
    'Tis but another anxious night,
    His pains the morrow may requite
    With all Revenge and Love can pay,                                  
    In guerdon for their long delay.
    Few hours remain, and he hath need
    Of rest, to nerve for many a deed
    Of slaughter; but within his soul
    The thoughts like troubled waters roll.
    He stood alone among the host;
    Not his the loud fanatic boast
    To plant the Crescent o'er the Cross,
    Or risk a life with little loss,
    Secure in paradise to be                                            
    By Houris loved immortally:
    Nor his, what burning patriots feel,
    The stern exaltedness of zeal,
    Profuse of blood, untired in toil,
    When battling on the parent soil.
    He stood alone--a renegade
    Against the country he betrayed;
    He stood alone amidst his band,
    Without a trusted heart or hand:
    They followed him, for he was brave,                                
    And great the spoil he got and gave;
    They crouched to him, for he had skill
    To warp and wield the vulgar will:
    But still his Christian origin
    With them was little less than sin.
    They envied even the faithless fame
    He earned beneath a Moslem name;
    Since he, their mightiest chief, had been
    In youth a bitter Nazarene.
    They did not know how Pride can stoop,                              
    When baffled feelings withering droop;
    They did not know how Hate can burn
    In hearts once changed from soft to stern;
    Nor all the false and fatal zeal
    The convert of Revenge can feel.
    He ruled them--man may rule the worst,
    By ever daring to be first:
    So lions o'er the jackals sway;
    The jackal points, he fells the prey,
    Then on the vulgar, yelling, press,                                 
    To gorge the relics of success.

                    XIII.

    His head grows fevered, and his pulse
    The quick successive throbs convulse;
    In vain from side to side he throws
    His form, in courtship of repose;
    Or if he dozed, a sound, a start
    Awoke him with a sunken heart.
    The turban on his hot brow pressed,
    The mail weighed lead-like on his breast,
    Though oft and long beneath its weight                              
    Upon his eyes had slumber sate,
    Without or couch or canopy,
    Except a rougher field and sky
    Than now might yield a warrior's bed,
    Than now along the heaven was spread.
    He could not rest, he could not stay
    Within his tent to wait for day,
    But walked him forth along the sand,
    Where thousand sleepers strewed the strand.
    What pillowed them? and why should he                               
    More wakeful than the humblest be,
    Since more their peril, worse their toil?
    And yet they fearless dream of spoil;
    While he alone, where thousands passed
    A night of sleep, perchance their last,
    In sickly vigil wandered on,
    And envied all he gazed upon.

                    XIV.

    He felt his soul become more light
    Beneath the freshness of the night.
    Cool was the silent sky, though calm,                               
    And bathed his brow with airy balm:
    Behind, the camp--before him lay,
    In many a winding creek and bay,
    Lepanto's gulf; and, on the brow
    Of Delphi's hill, unshaken snow,
    High and eternal, such as shone
    Through thousand summers brightly gone,
    Along the gulf, the mount, the clime;
    It will not melt, like man, to time:
    Tyrant and slave are swept away,                                    
    Less formed to wear before the ray;
    But that white veil, the lightest, frailest,
    Which on the mighty mount thou hailest,
    While tower and tree are torn and rent,
    Shines o'er its craggy battlement;
    In form a peak, in height a cloud,
    In texture like a hovering shroud,
    Thus high by parting Freedom spread,
    As from her fond abode she fled,
    And lingered on the spot, where long                                
    Her prophet spirit spake in song.
    Oh! still her step at moments falters
    O'er withered fields, and ruined altars,
    And fain would wake, in souls too broken,
    By pointing to each glorious token:
    But vain her voice, till better days
    Dawn in those yet remembered rays,
    Which shone upon the Persian flying,
    And saw the Spartan smile in dying.

                    XV.

    Not mindless of these mighty times                                  
    Was Alp, despite his flight and crimes;
    And through this night, as on he wandered,
    And o'er the past and present pondered,
    And thought upon the glorious dead
    Who there in better cause had bled,
    He felt how faint and feebly dim
    The fame that could accrue to him,
    Who cheered the band, and waved the sword,
    A traitor in a turbaned horde;
    And led them to the lawless siege,                                  
    Whose best success were sacrilege.
    Not so had those his fancy numbered,
    The chiefs whose dust around him slumbered;
    Their phalanx marshalled on the plain,
    Whose bulwarks were not then in vain.
    They fell devoted, but undying;
    The very gale their names seemed sighing;
    The waters murmured of their name;
    The woods were peopled with their fame;
    The silent pillar, lone and grey,                                   
    Claimed kindred with their sacred clay;
    Their spirits wrapped the dusky mountain,
    Their memory sparkled o'er the fountain;
    The meanest rill, the mightiest river
    Rolled mingling with their fame for ever.
    Despite of every yoke she bears,
    That land is Glory's still and theirs!
    'Tis still a watch-word to the earth:
    When man would do a deed of worth
    He points to Greece, and turns to tread,                            
    So sanctioned, on the tyrant's head:
    He looks to her, and rushes on
    Where life is lost, or Freedom won.

                    XVI.

    Still by the shore Alp mutely mused,
    And wooed the freshness Night diffused.
    There shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea,
    Which changeless rolls eternally;
    So that wildest of waves, in their angriest mood,
    Scarce break on the bounds of the land for a rood;
    And the powerless moon beholds them flow,                           
    Heedless if she come or go:
    Calm or high, in main or bay,
    On their course she hath no sway.
    The rock unworn its base doth bare,
    And looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;
    And the fringe of the foam may be seen below,
    On the line that it left long ages ago:
    A smooth short space of yellow sand
    Between it and the greener land.

    He wandered on along the beach,                                     
    Till within the range of a carbine's reach
    Of the leaguered wall; but they saw him not,
    Or how could he 'scape from the hostile shot?
    Did traitors lurk in the Christians' hold?
    Were their hands grown stiff, or their hearts waxed cold?
    I know not, in sooth; but from yonder wall
    There flashed no fire, and there hissed no ball,
    Though he stood beneath the bastion's frown,
    That flanked the seaward gate of the town;
    Though he heard the sound, and could almost tell                    
    The sullen words of the sentinel,
    As his measured step on the stone below
    Clanked, as he paced it to and fro;
    And he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall
    Hold o'er the dead their Carnival,
    Gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb;
    They were too busy to bark at him!
    From a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh,
    As ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;
    And their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull,          
    As it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,
    As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,
    When they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;
    So well had they broken a lingering fast
    With those who had fallen for that night's repast.
    And Alp knew, by the turbans that rolled on the sand,
    The foremost of these were the best of his band:
    Crimson and green were the shawls of their wear,
    And each scalp had a single long tuft of hair,
    All the rest was shaven and bare.                                   
    The scalps were in the wild dog's maw,
    The hair was tangled round his jaw:
    But close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,
    There sat a vulture flapping a wolf,
    Who had stolen from the hills, but kept away,
    Scared by the dogs, from the human prey;
    But he seized on his share of a steed that lay,
    Picked by the birds, on the sands of the bay.

                    XVII.

    Alp turned him from the sickening sight:
    Never had shaken his nerves in fight;                               
    But he better could brook to behold the dying,
    Deep in the tide of their warm blood lying,
    Scorched with the death-thirst, and writhing in vain,
    Than the perishing dead who are past all pain.
    There is something of pride in the perilous hour,
    Whate'er be the shape in which Death may lower;
    For Fame is there to say who bleeds,
    And Honour's eye on daring deeds!
    But when all is past, it is humbling to tread
    O'er the weltering field of the tombless dead,                 
    And see worms of the earth, and fowls of the air,
    Beasts of the forest, all gathering there;
    All regarding man as their prey,
    All rejoicing in his decay.

                    XVIII.

    There is a temple in ruin stands,
    Fashioned by long forgotten hands;
    Two or three columns, and many a stone,
    Marble and granite, with grass o'ergrown!
    Out upon Time! it will leave no more
    Of the things to come than the things before!              
    Out upon Time! who for ever will leave
    But enough of the past for the future to grieve
    O'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be:
    What we have seen, our sons shall see;
    Remnants of things that have passed away,
    Fragments of stone, reared by creatures of clay!

                    XIX.

    He sate him down at a pillar's base,
    And passed his hand athwart his face;
    Like one in dreary musing mood,
    Declining was his attitude;                                         
    His head was drooping on his breast,
    Fevered, throbbing, and oppressed;
    And o'er his brow, so downward bent,
    Oft his beating fingers went,
    Hurriedly, as you may see
    Your own run over the ivory key,
    Ere the measured tone is taken
    By the chords you would awaken.
    There he sate all heavily,
    As he heard the night-wind sigh.                                    
    Was it the wind through some hollow stone,
    Sent that soft and tender moan?
    He lifted his head, and he looked on the sea,
    But it was unrippled as glass may be;
    He looked on the long grass--it waved not a blade;
    How was that gentle sound conveyed?
    He looked to the banners--each flag lay still,
    So did the leaves on Cith?ron's hill,
    And he felt not a breath come over his cheek;
    What did that sudden sound bespeak?                                 
    He turned to the left--is he sure of sight?
    There sate a lady, youthful and bright!

                    XX.

    He started up with more of fear
    Than if an arm?d foe were near.
    "God of my fathers! what is here?
    Who art thou? and wherefore sent
    So near a hostile armament?"
    His trembling hands refused to sign
    The cross he deemed no more divine:
    He had resumed it in that hour,                                 
    But Conscience wrung away the power.
    He gazed, he saw; he knew the face
    Of beauty, and the form of grace;
    It was Francesca by his side,
    The maid who might have been his bride!


    The rose was yet upon her cheek,
    But mellowed with a tenderer streak:
    Where was the play of her soft lips fled?
    Gone was the smile that enlivened their red.
    The Ocean's calm within their view,                             
    Beside her eye had less of blue;
    But like that cold wave it stood still,
    And its glance, though clear, was chill.
    Around her form a thin robe twining,
    Nought concealed her bosom shining;
    Through the parting of her hair,
    Floating darkly downward there,
    Her rounded arm showed white and bare:
    And ere yet she made reply,
    Once she raised her hand on high;                                   
    It was so wan, and transparent of hue,
    You might have seen the moon shine through.

                    XXI.

    "I come from my rest to him I love best,
    That I may be happy, and he may be blessed.
    I have passed the guards, the gate, the wall;
    Sought thee in safety through foes and all.
    'Tis said the lion will turn and flee
    From a maid in the pride of her purity;
    And the Power on high, that can shield the good
    Thus from the tyrant of the wood,                                   
    Hath extended its mercy to guard me as well
    From the hands of the leaguering Infidel.
    I come--and if I come in vain,
    Never, oh never, we meet again!
    Thou hast done a fearful deed
    In falling away from thy fathers' creed:
    But dash that turban to earth, and sign
    The sign of the cross, and for ever be mine;
    Wring the black drop from thy heart,
    And to-morrow unites us no more to part."          

    "And where should our bridal couch be spread?
    In the midst of the dying and the dead?
    For to-morrow we give to the slaughter and flame
    The sons and the shrines of the Christian name.
    None, save thou and thine, I've sworn,
    Shall be left upon the morn:
    But thee will I bear to a lovely spot,
    Where our hands shall be joined, and our sorrow forgot.
    There thou yet shall be my bride,
    When once again I've quelled the pride                              
    Of Venice; and her hated race
    Have felt the arm they would debase
    Scourge, with a whip of scorpions, those
    Whom Vice and Envy made my foes."

    Upon his hand she laid her own--
    Light was the touch, but it thrilled to the bone,
    And shot a chillness to his heart,
    Which fixed him beyond the power to start.
    Though slight was that grasp so mortal cold,
    He could not loose him from its hold;                               
    But never did clasp of one so dear
    Strike on the pulse with such feeling of fear,
    As those thin fingers, long and white,
    Froze through his blood by their touch that night.
    The feverish glow of his brow was gone,
    And his heart sank so still that it felt like stone,
    As he looked on the face, and beheld its hue,
    So deeply changed from what he knew:
    Fair but faint--without the ray
    Of mind, that made each feature play                                
    Like sparkling waves on a sunny day;
    And her motionless lips lay still as death,
    And her words came forth without her breath,
    And there rose not a heave o'er her bosom's swell,
    And there seemed not a pulse in her veins to dwell.
    Though her eye shone out, yet the lids were fixed,
    And the glance that it gave was wild and unmixed
    With aught of change, as the eyes may seem
    Of the restless who walk in a troubled dream;
    Like the figures on arras, that gloomily glare,                     
    Stirred by the breath of the wintry air
    So seen by the dying lamp's fitful light,
    Lifeless, but life-like, and awful to sight;
    As they seem, through the dimness, about to come down
    From the shadowy wall where their images frown;
    Fearfully flitting to and fro,
    As the gusts on the tapestry come and go.

    "If not for love of me be given
    Thus much, then, for the love of Heaven,--
    Again I say--that turban tear                                       
    From off thy faithless brow, and swear
    Thine injured country's sons to spare,
    Or thou art lost; and never shalt see--
    Not earth--that's past--but Heaven or me.
    If this thou dost accord, albeit
    A heavy doom' tis thine to meet,
    That doom shall half absolve thy sin,
    And Mercy's gate may receive thee within:
    But pause one moment more, and take
    The curse of Him thou didst forsake;                                
    And look once more to Heaven, and see
    Its love for ever shut from thee.
    There is a light cloud by the moon--
    'Tis passing, and will pass full soon--
    If, by the time its vapoury sail
    Hath ceased her shaded orb to veil,
    Thy heart within thee is not changed,
    Then God and man are both avenged;
    Dark will thy doom be, darker still
    Thine immortality of ill."                                          

    Alp looked to heaven, and saw on high
    The sign she spake of in the sky;
    But his heart was swollen, and turned aside,
    By deep interminable pride.
    This first false passion of his breast
    Rolled like a torrent o'er the rest.
    He sue for mercy! He dismayed
    By wild words of a timid maid!
    He, wronged by Venice, vow to save
    Her sons, devoted to the grave!                                     
    No--though that cloud were thunder's worst,
    And charged to crush him--let it burst!

    He looked upon it earnestly,
    Without an accent of reply;
    He watched it passing; it is flown:
    Full on his eye the clear moon shone,
    And thus he spake--"Whate'er my fate,
    I am no changeling--'tis too late:
    The reed in storms may bow and quiver,
    Then rise again; the tree must shiver.                              
    What Venice made me, I must be,
    Her foe in all, save love to thee:
    But thou art safe: oh, fly with me!"
    He turned, but she is gone!
    Nothing is there but the column stone.
    Hath she sunk in the earth, or melted in air?
    He saw not--he knew not--but nothing is there.

                    XXII.

    The night is past, and shines the sun
    As if that morn were a jocund one.
    Lightly and brightly breaks away                                    
    The Morning from her mantle grey,
    And the Noon will look on a sultry day.
    Hark to the trump, and the drum,
    And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
    And the flap of the banners, that flit as they're borne,
    And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,
    And the clash, and the shout, "They come! they come!"
    The horsetails are plucked from the ground, and the sword
    From its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the word.
    Tartar, and Spahi, and Turcoman,                                    
    Strike your tents, and throng to the van;
    Mount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,
    That the fugitive may flee in vain,
    When he breaks from the town; and none escape,
    Ag?d or young, in the Christian shape;
    While your fellows on foot, in a fiery mass,
    Bloodstain the breach through which they pass.
    The steeds are all bridled, and snort to the rein;
    Curved is each neck, and flowing each mane;
    White is the foam of their champ on the bit;                        
    The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;
    The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,
    And crush the wall they have crumbled before:
    Forms in his phalanx each Janizar;
    Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,
    So is the blade of his scimitar;
    The Khan and the Pachas are all at their post;
    The Vizier himself at the head of the host.
    When the culverin's signal is fired, then on;
    Leave not in Corinth a living one--                                 
    A priest at her altars, a chief in her halls,
    A hearth in her mansions, a stone on her walls.
    God and the prophet--Alla Hu!
    Up to the skies with that wild halloo!
    "There the breach lies for passage, the ladder to scale;
    And your hands on your sabres, and how should ye fail?
    He who first downs with the red cross may crave
    His heart's dearest wish; let him ask it, and have!"
    Thus uttered Coumourgi, the dauntless Vizier;
    The reply was the brandish of sabre and spear,                      
    And the shout of fierce thousands in joyous ire:--
    Silence--hark to the signal--fire!

                    XXIII.

    As the wolves, that headlong go
    On the stately buffalo,
    Though with fiery eyes, and angry roar,
    And hoofs that stamp, and horns that gore,
    He tramples on earth, or tosses on high
    The foremost, who rush on his strength but to die
    Thus against the wall they went,
    Thus the first were backward bent;                             
    Many a bosom, sheathed in brass,
    Strewed the earth like broken glass,
    Shivered by the shot, that tore
    The ground whereon they moved no more:
    Even as they fell, in files they lay,
    Like the mower's grass at the close of day,
    When his work is done on the levelled plain;
    Such was the fall of the foremost slain.

                    XXIV.

    As the spring-tides, with heavy plash,
    From the cliffs invading dash                                       
    Huge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,
    Till white and thundering down they go,
    Like the avalanche's snow
    On the Alpine vales below;
    Thus at length, outbreathed and worn,
    Corinth's sons were downward borne
    By the long and oft renewed
    Charge of the Moslem multitude.
    In firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,
    Heaped by the host of the Infidel,                                  
    Hand to hand, and foot to foot:
    Nothing there, save Death, was mute;
    Stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry
    For quarter, or for victory,
    Mingle there with the volleying thunder,
    Which makes the distant cities wonder
    How the sounding battle goes,
    If with them, or for their foes;
    If they must mourn, or may rejoice
    In that annihilating voice,                                         
    Which pierces the deep hills through and through
    With an echo dread and new:
    You might have heard it, on that day,
    O'er Salamis and Megara;
    (We have heard the hearers say,)
    Even unto Pir?us' bay.

                    XXV.

    From the point of encountering blades to the hilt,
    Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;
    But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,
    And all but the after carnage done.                                 
    Shriller shrieks now mingling come
    From within the plundered dome:
    Hark to the haste of flying feet,
    That splash in the blood of the slippery street;
    But here and there, where 'vantage ground
    Against the foe may still be found,
    Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,
    Make a pause, and turn again--
    With banded backs against the wall,
    Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.                                   
    There stood an old man--his hairs were white,
    But his veteran arm was full of might:
    So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,
    The dead before him, on that day,
    In a semicircle lay;
    Still he combated unwounded,
    Though retreating, unsurrounded.
    Many a scar of former fight
    Lurked beneath his corslet bright;
    But of every wound his body bore,                                   
    Each and all had been ta'en before:
    Though ag?d, he was so iron of limb,
    Few of our youth could cope with him,
    And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,
    Outnumbered his thin hairs of silver grey.
    From right to left his sabre swept:
    Many an Othman mother wept
    Sons that were unborn, when dipped
    His weapon first in Moslem gore,
    Ere his years could count a score.                                  
    Of all he might have been the sire
    Who fell that day beneath his ire:
    For, sonless left long years ago,
    His wrath made many a childless foe;
    And since the day, when in the strait
    His only boy had met his fate,
    His parent's iron hand did doom
    More than a human hecatomb.
    If shades by carnage be appeased,
    Patroclus' spirit less was pleased                                  
    Than his, Minotti's son, who died
    Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.
    Buried he lay, where thousands before
    For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;
    What of them is left, to tell
    Where they lie, and how they fell?
    Not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;
    But they live in the verse that immortally saves.

                    XXVI.

    Hark to the Allah shout! a band
    Of the Mussulman bravest and best is at hand;                       
    Their leader's nervous arm is bare,
    Swifter to smite, and never to spare--
    Unclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;
    Thus in the fight is he ever known:
    Others a gaudier garb may show,
    To tempt the spoil of the greedy foe;
    Many a hand's on a richer hilt,
    But none on a steel more ruddily gilt;
    Many a loftier turban may wear,--
    Alp is but known by the white arm bare;                             
    Look through the thick of the fight,'tis there!
    There is not a standard on that shore
    So well advanced the ranks before;
    There is not a banner in Moslem war
    Will lure the Delhis half so far;
    It glances like a falling star!
    Where'er that mighty arm is seen,
    The bravest be, or late have been;
    There the craven cries for quarter
    Vainly to the vengeful Tartar;                                      
    Or the hero, silent lying,
    Scorns to yield a groan in dying;
    Mustering his last feeble blow
    'Gainst the nearest levelled foe,
    Though faint beneath the mutual wound,
    Grappling on the gory ground.

                    XXVII.

    Still the old man stood erect.
    And Alp's career a moment checked.
    "Yield thee, Minotti; quarter take,
    For thine own, thy daughter's sake."                                

    "Never, Renegado, never!
    Though the life of thy gift would last for ever."

    "Francesca!--Oh, my promised bride!
    Must she too perish by thy pride!"

    "She is safe."--"Where? where?"--"In Heaven;
    From whence thy traitor soul is driven--
    Far from thee, and undefiled."
    Grimly then Minotti smiled,
    As he saw Alp staggering bow
    Before his words, as with a blow.                                   

    "Oh God! when died she?"--"Yesternight--
    Nor weep I for her spirit's flight:
    None of my pure race shall be
    Slaves to Mahomet and thee--
    Come on!"--That challenge is in vain--
    Alp's already with the slain!
    While Minotti's words were wreaking
    More revenge in bitter speaking
    Than his falchion's point had found,
    Had the time allowed to wound,                                      
    From within the neighbouring porch
    Of a long defended church,
    Where the last and desperate few
    Would the failing fight renew,
    The sharp shot dashed Alp to the ground;
    Ere an eye could view the wound
    That crashed through the brain of the infidel,
    Round he spun, and down he fell;
    A flash like fire within his eyes
    Blazed, as he bent no more to rise,                                 
    And then eternal darkness sunk
    Through all the palpitating trunk;
    Nought of life left, save a quivering
    Where his limbs were slightly shivering:
    They turned him on his back; his breast
    And brow were stained with gore and dust,
    And through his lips the life-blood oozed,
    From its deep veins lately loosed;
    But in his pulse there was no throb,
    Nor on his lips one dying sob;                                      
    Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath
    Heralded his way to death:
    Ere his very thought could pray,
    Unaneled he passed away,
    Without a hope from Mercy's aid,--
    To the last a Renegade.

                    XXVIII.

    Fearfully the yell arose
    Of his followers, and his foes;
    These in joy, in fury those:
    Then again in conflict mixing,                                  
    Clashing swords, and spears transfixing,
    Interchanged the blow and thrust,
    Hurling warriors in the dust.
    Street by street, and foot by foot,
    Still Minotti dares dispute
    The latest portion of the land
    Left beneath his high command;
    With him, aiding heart and hand,
    The remnant of his gallant band.
    Still the church is tenable,                                        
      Whence issued late the fated ball
      That half avenged the city's fall,
    When Alp, her fierce assailant, fell:
    Thither bending sternly back,
    They leave before a bloody track;
    And, with their faces to the foe,
    Dealing wounds with every blow,
    The chief, and his retreating train,
    Join to those within the fane;
    There they yet may breathe awhile,                                  
    Sheltered by the massy pile.

                    XXIX.

    Brief breathing-time! the turbaned host,
    With added ranks and raging boast,
    Press onwards with such strength and heat,
    Their numbers balk their own retreat;
    For narrow the way that led to the spot
    Where still the Christians yielded not;
    And the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try
    Through the massy column to turn and fly;
    They perforce must do or die.                                       
    They die; but ere their eyes could close,
    Avengers o'er their bodies rose;
    Fresh and furious, fast they fill
    The ranks unthinned, though slaughtered still;
    And faint the weary Christians wax
    Before the still renewed attacks:
    And now the Othmans gain the gate;
    Still resists its iron weight,
    And still, all deadly aimed and hot,
    From every crevice comes the shot;                                  
    From every shattered window pour
    The volleys of the sulphurous shower:
    But the portal wavering grows and weak--
    The iron yields, the hinges creak--
    It bends--it falls--and all is o'er;
    Lost Corinth may resist no more!

                    XXX.

    Darkly, sternly, and all alone,
    Minotti stood o'er the altar stone:
    Madonna's face upon him shone,
    Painted in heavenly hues above,                                     
    With eyes of light and looks of love;
    And placed upon that holy shrine
    To fix our thoughts on things divine,
    When pictured there, we kneeling see
    Her, and the boy-God on her knee,
    Smiling sweetly on each prayer
    To Heaven, as if to waft it there.
    Still she smiled; even now she smiles,
    Though slaughter streams along her aisles:
    Minotti lifted his ag?d eye,                                        
    And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,
    Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;
    And still he stood, while with steel and flame,
    Inward and onward the Mussulman came.

                    XXXI.

    The vaults beneath the mosaic stone
    Contained the dead of ages gone;
    Their names were on the graven floor,
    But now illegible with gore;
    The carv?d crests, and curious hues
    The varied marble's veins diffuse,                                  
    Were smeared, and slippery--stained, and strown
    With broken swords, and helms o'erthrown:
    There were dead above, and the dead below
    Lay cold in many a coffined row;
    You might see them piled in sable state,
    By a pale light through a gloomy grate;
    But War had entered their dark caves,
    And stored along the vaulted graves
    Her sulphurous treasures, thickly spread
    In masses by the fleshless dead:                                    
    Here, throughout the siege, had been
    The Christians' chiefest magazine;
    To these a late formed train now led,
    Minotti's last and stern resource
    Against the foe's o'erwhelming force.

                    XXXII.

    The foe came on, and few remain
    To strive, and those must strive in vain:
    For lack of further lives, to slake
    The thirst of vengeance now awake,
    With barbarous blows they gash the dead,                            
    And lop the already lifeless head,
    And fell the statues from their niche,
    And spoil the shrines of offerings rich,
    And from each other's rude hands wrest
    The silver vessels Saints had blessed.
    To the high altar on they go;
    Oh, but it made a glorious show!
    On its table still behold
    The cup of consecrated gold;
    Massy and deep, a glittering prize,                                
    Brightly it sparkles to plunderers' eyes:
    That morn it held the holy wine,
    Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,
    Which his worshippers drank at the break of day,
    To shrive their souls ere they joined in the fray.
    Still a few drops within it lay;
    And round the sacred table glow
    Twelve lofty lamps, in splendid row,
    From the purest metal cast;
    A spoil--the richest, and the last.                                

                    XXXIII.

    So near they came, the nearest stretched
    To grasp the spoil he almost reached
      When old Minotti's hand
    Touched with the torch the train--
        'Tis fired!
    Spire, vaults, the shrine, the spoil, the slain,
      The turbaned victors, the Christian band,
    All that of living or dead remain,
    Hurled on high with the shivered fane,
        In one wild roar expired!                                 
    The shattered town--the walls thrown down--
    The waves a moment backward bent--
    The hills that shake, although unrent,
      As if an Earthquake passed--
    The thousand shapeless things all driven
    In cloud and flame athwart the heaven,
      By that tremendous blast--
    Proclaimed the desperate conflict o'er
    On that too long afflicted shore:
    Up to the sky like rockets go                                      
    All that mingled there below:
    Many a tall and goodly man,
    Scorched and shrivelled to a span,
    When he fell to earth again
    Like a cinder strewed the plain:
    Down the ashes shower like rain;
    Some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles
    With a thousand circling wrinkles;
    Some fell on the shore, but, far away,
    Scattered o'er the isthmus lay;                                    
    Christian or Moslem, which be they?
    Let their mothers see and say!
    When in cradled rest they lay,
    And each nursing mother smiled
    On the sweet sleep of her child,
    Little deemed she such a day
    Would rend those tender limbs away.
    Not the matrons that them bore
    Could discern their offspring more;
    That one moment left no trace                                      
    More of human form or face
    Save a scattered scalp or bone:
    And down came blazing rafters, strown
    Around, and many a falling stone,
    Deeply dinted in the clay,
    All blackened there and reeking lay.
    All the living things that heard
    The deadly earth-shock disappeared:
    The wild birds flew; the wild dogs fled,
    And howling left the unburied dead;                       
    The camels from their keepers broke;
    The distant steer forsook the yoke--
    The nearer steed plunged o'er the plain,
    And burst his girth, and tore his rein;
    The bull-frog's note, from out the marsh,
    Deep-mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;
    The wolves yelled on the caverned hill
    Where Echo rolled in thunder still;
    The jackal's troop, in gathered cry,
    Bayed from afar complainingly,                                     
    With a mixed and mournful sound,
    Like crying babe, and beaten hound:
    With sudden wing, and ruffled breast,
    The eagle left his rocky nest,
    And mounted nearer to the sun,
    The clouds beneath him seemed so dun;
    Their smoke assailed his startled beak,
    And made him higher soar and shriek--
      Thus was Corinth lost and won!




                       PARISINA.

                    I.

    It is the hour when from the boughs
      The nightingale's high note is heard;
    It is the hour when lovers' vows
      Seem sweet in every whispered word;
    And gentle winds, and waters near,
    Make music to the lonely ear.
    Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
    And in the sky the stars are met,
    And on the wave is deeper blue,
    And on the leaf a browner hue,                                       
    And in the heaven that clear obscure,
    So softly dark, and darkly pure,
    Which follows the decline of day,
    As twilight melts beneath the moon away.

                    II.

    But it is not to list to the waterfall
    That Parisina leaves her hall,
    And it is not to gaze on the heavenly light
    That the Lady walks in the shadow of night;
    And if she sits in Este's bower,
    'Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower;                      
    She listens--but not for the nightingale--
    Though her ear expects as soft a tale.
    There glides a step through the foliage thick,
    And her cheek grows pale, and her heart beats quick.
    There whispers a voice through the rustling leaves,
    And her blush returns, and her bosom heaves:
    A moment more--and they shall meet--
    'Tis past--her Lover's at her feet.

                    III.

    And what unto them is the world beside,
    With all its change of time and tide?                                
    Its living things--its earth and sky--
    Are nothing to their mind and eye.
    And heedless as the dead are they
      Of aught around, above, beneath;
    As if all else had passed away,
      They only for each other breathe;
    Their very sighs are full of joy
      So deep, that did it not decay,
    That happy madness would destroy
      The hearts which feel its fiery sway:                              
    Of guilt, of peril, do they deem
    In that tumultuous tender dream?
    Who that have felt that passion's power,
    Or paused, or feared in such an hour?
    Or thought how brief such moments last?
    But yet--they are already past!
    Alas! we must awake before
    We know such vision comes no more.

                    IV.

    With many a lingering look they leave
      The spot of guilty gladness past:                                  
    And though they hope, and vow, they grieve,
      As if that parting were the last.
    The frequent sigh--the long embrace--
      The lip that there would cling for ever,
    While gleams on Parisina's face
      The Heaven she fears will not forgive her,
    As if each calmly conscious star
    Beheld her frailty from afar--
    The frequent sigh, the long embrace,
    Yet binds them to their trysting-place.                              
    But it must come, and they must part
    In fearful heaviness of heart,
    With all the deep and shuddering chill
    Which follows fast the deeds of ill.

                    V.

    And Hugo is gone to his lonely bed,
      To covet there another's bride;
    But she must lay her conscious head
      A husband's trusting heart beside.
    But fevered in her sleep she seems,
    And red her cheek with troubled dreams,                              
      And mutters she in her unrest
    A name she dare not breathe by day,
      And clasps her Lord unto the breast
    Which pants for one away:
    And he to that embrace awakes,
    And, happy in the thought, mistakes
    That dreaming sigh, and warm caress,
    For such as he was wont to bless;
    And could in very fondness weep
    O'er her who loves him even in sleep.                                

                    VI.

    He clasped her sleeping to his heart,
      And listened to each broken word:
    He hears--Why doth Prince Azo start,
      As if the Archangel's voice he heard?
    And well he may--a deeper doom
    Could scarcely thunder o'er his tomb,
    When he shall wake to sleep no more,
    And stand the eternal throne before.
    And well he may--his earthly peace
    Upon that sound is doomed to cease.                                  
    That sleeping whisper of a name
    Bespeaks her guilt and Azo's shame.
    And whose that name? that o'er his pillow
    Sounds fearful as the breaking billow,
    Which rolls the plank upon the shore,
      And dashes on the pointed rock
    The wretch who sinks to rise no more,--
      So came upon his soul the shock.
    And whose that name?--'tis Hugo's,--his--
    In sooth he had not deemed of this!--                               
    'Tis Hugo's,--he, the child of one
    He loved--his own all-evil son--
    The offspring of his wayward youth,
    When he betrayed Bianca's truth,
    The maid whose folly could confide
    In him who made her not his bride.

                    VII.

    He plucked his poniard in its sheath,
      But sheathed it ere the point was bare;
    Howe'er unworthy now to breathe,
      He could not slay a thing so fair--                               
      At least, not smiling--sleeping--there--
    Nay, more:--he did not wake her then,
      But gazed upon her with a glance
      Which, had she roused her from her trance,
    Had frozen her sense to sleep again;
    And o'er his brow the burning lamp
    Gleamed on the dew-drops big and damp.
    She spake no more--but still she slumbered--
    While, in his thought, her days are numbered.

                    VIII.

    And with the morn he sought and found,                              
    In many a tale from those around,
    The proof of all he feared to know,
    Their present guilt--his future woe;
    The long-conniving damsels seek
      To save themselves, and would transfer
      The guilt--the shame--the doom--to her:
    Concealment is no more--they speak
    All circumstance which may compel
    Full credence to the tale they tell:
    And Azo's tortured heart and ear                                    
    Have nothing more to feel or hear.

                    IX.

    He was not one who brooked delay:
      Within the chamber of his state,
    The Chief of Este's ancient sway
      Upon his throne of judgement sate;
    His nobles and his guards are there,--
    Before him is the sinful pair;
    Both young,--and one how passing fair!
    With swordless belt, and fettered hand,
    Oh, Christ! that thus a son should stand                            
      Before a father's face!
    Yet thus must Hugo meet his sire,
    And hear the sentence of his ire,
      The tale of his disgrace!
    And yet he seems not overcome,
    Although, as yet, his voice be dumb.

                    X.

    And still,--and pale--and silently
      Did Parisina wait her doom;
    How changed since last her speaking eye
      Glanced gladness round the glittering room,                       
    Where high-born men were proud to wait--
    Where Beauty watched to imitate
      Her gentle voice--her lovely mien--
    And gather from her air and gait
      The graces of its Queen:
    Then,--had her eye in sorrow wept,
    A thousand warriors forth had leapt,
    A thousand swords had sheathless shone,
    And made her quarrel all their own.
    Now,--what is she? and what are they?                               
    Can she command, or these obey?
    All silent and unheeding now,
    With downcast eyes and knitting brow,
    And folded arms, and freezing air,
    And lips that scarce their scorn forbear,
    Her knights, her dames, her court--is there:
    And he--the chosen one, whose lance
    Had yet been couched before her glance,
    Who--were his arm a moment free--
    Had died or gained her liberty;                                     
    The minion of his father's bride,--
    He, too, is fettered by her side;
    Nor sees her swoln and full eye swim
    Less for her own despair than him:
    Those lids--o'er which the violet vein
    Wandering, leaves a tender stain,
    Shining through the smoothest white
    That e'er did softest kiss invite--
    Now seemed with hot and livid glow
    To press, not shade, the orbs below;                                
    Which glance so heavily, and fill,
    As tear on tear grows gathering still

                    XI.

    And he for her had also wept,
      But for the eyes that on him gazed:
    His sorrow, if he felt it, slept;
      Stern and erect his brow was raised.
    Whate'er the grief his soul avowed,
    He would not shrink before the crowd;
    But yet he dared not look on her;
    Remembrance of the hours that were--                                
    His guilt--his love--his present state--
    His father's wrath, all good men's hate--
    His earthly, his eternal fate--
    And hers,--oh, hers! he dared not throw
    One look upon that death-like brow!
    Else had his rising heart betrayed
    Remorse for all the wreck it made.

                    XII.

    And Azo spake:--"But yesterday
      I gloried in a wife and son;
    That dream this morning passed away;                                
      Ere day declines, I shall have none.
    My life must linger on alone;
    Well,--let that pass,--there breathes not one
    Who would not do as I have done:
    Those ties are broken--not by me;
      Let that too pass;--the doom's prepared!
    Hugo, the priest awaits on thee,
      And then--thy crime's reward!
    Away! address thy prayers to Heaven.
      Before its evening stars are met,                                 
    Learn if thou there canst be forgiven:
      Its mercy may absolve thee yet.
    But here, upon the earth beneath,
      There is no spot where thou and I
    Together for an hour could breathe:
      Farewell! I will not see thee die--
    But thou, frail thing! shall view his head--
      Away! I cannot speak the rest:
      Go! woman of the wanton breast;
    Not I, but thou his blood dost shed:                                
    Go! if that sight thou canst outlive,
    And joy thee in the life I give."

                    XIII.

    And here stern Azo hid his face--
      For on his brow the swelling vein
      Throbbed as if back upon his brain
      The hot blood ebbed and flowed again;
    And therefore bowed he for a space,
      And passed his shaking hand along
      His eye, to veil it from the throng;
    While Hugo raised his chain?d hands,                                
    And for a brief delay demands
    His father's ear: the silent sire
    Forbids not what his words require.
      "It is not that I dread the death--
    For thou hast seen me by thy side
    All redly through the battle ride,
    And that--not once a useless brand--
    Thy slaves have wrested from my hand
    Hath shed more blood in cause of thine,
    Than e'er can stain the axe of mine:                           
      Thou gav'st, and may'st resume my breath,
    A gift for which I thank thee not;
    Nor are my mother's wrongs forgot,
    Her slighted love and ruined name,
    Her offspring's heritage of shame;
    But she is in the grave, where he,
    Her son--thy rival--soon shall be.
    Her broken heart--my severed head--
    Shall witness for thee from the dead
    How trusty and how tender were                                      
    Thy youthful love--paternal care.
    'Tis true that I have done thee wrong--
      But wrong for wrong:--this,--deemed thy bride,
      The other victim of thy pride,--
    Thou know'st for me was destined long;
    Thou saw'st, and coveted'st her charms;
      And with thy very crime--my birth,--
      Thou taunted'st me--as little worth;
    A match ignoble for her arms;
    Because, forsooth, I could not claim                                
    The lawful heirship of thy name,
    Nor sit on Este's lineal throne;
      Yet, were a few short summers mine,
      My name should more than Este's shine
    With honours all my own.
    I had a sword--and have a breast
    That should have won as haught a crest
    As ever waved along the line
    Of all these sovereign sires of thine.
    Not always knightly spurs are worn                                  
    The brightest by the better born;
    And mine have lanced my courser's flank
    Before proud chiefs of princely rank,
    When charging to the cheering cry
    Of 'Este and of Victory!'
    I will not plead the cause of crime,
    Nor sue thee to redeem from time
    A few brief hours or days that must
    At length roll o'er my reckless dust;--
    Such maddening moments as my past,                                  
    They could not, and they did not, last;--
    Albeit my birth and name be base,
    And thy nobility of race
    Disdained to deck a thing like me--
      Yet in my lineaments they trace
      Some features of my father's face,
    And in my spirit--all of thee.
    From thee this tamelessness of heart--
    From thee--nay, wherefore dost thou start?---
    From thee in all their vigour came                                  
    My arm of strength, my soul of flame--
    Thou didst not give me life alone,
    But all that made me more thine own.
    See what thy guilty love hath done!
    Repaid thee with too like a son!
    I am no bastard in my soul,
    For that, like thine, abhorred control;
    And for my breath, that hasty boon
    Thou gav'st and wilt resume so soon,
    I valued it no more than thou,                                      
    When rose thy casque above thy brow,
    And we, all side by side, have striven,
    And o'er the dead our coursers driven:
    The past is nothing--and at last
    The future can but be the past;
    Yet would I that I then had died:
      For though thou work'dst my mother's ill,
    And made thy own my destined bride,
      I feel thou art my father still:
    And harsh as sounds thy hard decree,                                
    'Tis not unjust, although from thee.
    Begot in sin, to die in shame,
    My life begun and ends the same:
    As erred the sire, so erred the son,
    And thou must punish both in one.
    My crime seems worst to human view,
    But God must judge between us too!"

                    XIV.

    He ceased--and stood with folded arms,
      On which the circling fetters sounded;
      And not an ear but felt as wounded,                               
      Of all the chiefs that there were ranked,
      When those dull chains in meeting clanked:
    Till Parisina's fatal charms
    Again attracted every eye--
    Would she thus hear him doomed to die!
    She stood, I said, all pale and still,
    The living cause of Hugo's ill:
    Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,
    Not once had turned to either side--
    Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,                             
    Or shade the glance o'er which they rose,
    But round their orbs of deepest blue
    The circling white dilated grew--
    And there with glassy gaze she stood
    As ice were in her curdled blood;
    But every now and then a tear
      So large and slowly gathered slid
      From the long dark fringe of that fair lid,
    It was a thing to see, not hear!
    And those who saw, it did surprise,                                 
    Such drops could fall from human eyes.
    To speak she thought--the imperfect note
    Was choked within her swelling throat,
    Yet seemed in that low hollow groan
    Her whole heart gushing in the tone.
    It ceased--again she thought to speak,
    Then burst her voice in one long shriek,
    And to the earth she fell like stone
    Or statue from its base o'erthrown,
    More like a thing that ne'er had life,--                            
    A monument of Azo's wife,--
    Than her, that living guilty thing,
    Whose every passion was a sting,
    Which urged to guilt, but could not bear
    That guilt's detection and despair.
    But yet she lived--and all too soon
    Recovered from that death-like swoon--
    But scarce to reason--every sense
    Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;
    And each frail fibre of her brain                                   
    (As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain,
    The erring arrow launch aside)
    Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--
    The past a blank, the future black,
    With glimpses of a dreary track,
    Like lightning on the desert path,
    When midnight storms are mustering wrath.
    She feared--she felt that something ill
    Lay on her soul, so deep and chill;
    That there was sin and shame she knew,                              
    That some one was to die--but who?
    She had forgotten:--did she breathe?
    Could this be still the earth beneath,
    The sky above, and men around;
    Or were they fiends who now so frowned
    On one, before whose eyes each eye
    Till then had smiled in sympathy?
    All was confused and undefined
    To her all-jarred and wandering mind;
    A chaos of wild hopes and fears:                                    
    And now in laughter, now in tears,
    But madly still in each extreme,
    She strove with that convulsive dream;
    For so it seemed on her to break:
    Oh! vainly must she strive to wake!

                    XV.

    The Convent bells are ringing,
      But mournfully and slow;
    In the grey square turret swinging,
      With a deep sound, to and fro.
      Heavily to the heart they go!                                     
    Hark! the hymn is singing--
      The song for the dead below,
      Or the living who shortly shall be so!
    For a departed being's soul
    The death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:
    He is near his mortal goal;
    Kneeling at the Friar's knee,
    Sad to hear, and piteous to see--
    Kneeling on the bare cold ground.
    With the block before and the guards around;                        
    And the headsman with his bare arm ready,
    That the blow may be both swift and steady,
    Feels if the axe be sharp and true
    Since he set its edge anew:
    While the crowd in a speechless circle gather
    To see the Son fall by the doom of the Father!

                    XVI.

    It is a lovely hour as yet
    Before the summer sun shall set,
    Which rose upon that heavy day,
    And mock'd it with his steadiest ray;                               
    And his evening beams are shed
    Full on Hugo's fated head,
    As his last confession pouring
    To the monk, his doom deploring
    In penitential holiness,
    He bends to hear his accents bless
    With absolution such as may
    Wipe our mortal stains away.
    That high sun on his head did glisten
    As he there did bow and listen,                                     
    And the rings of chestnut hair
    Curled half down his neck so bare;
    But brighter still the beam was thrown
    Upon the axe which near him shone
    With a clear and ghastly glitter----
    Oh! that parting hour was bitter!
    Even the stern stood chilled with awe:
    Dark the crime, and just the law--
    Yet they shuddered as they saw.

                    XVII.

    The parting prayers are said and over                               
    Of that false son, and daring lover!
    His beads and sins are all recounted,
    His hours to their last minute mounted;
    His mantling cloak before was stripped,
    His bright brown locks must now be clipped;
    'Tis done--all closely are they shorn;
    The vest which till this moment worn--
    The scarf which Parisina gave--
    Must not adorn him to the grave.
    Even that must now be thrown aside,                                 
    And o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;
    But no--that last indignity
    Shall ne'er approach his haughty eye.
    All feelings seemingly subdued,
    In deep disdain were half renewed,
    When headsman's hands prepared to bind
    Those eyes which would not brook such blind,
    As if they dared not look on death.
    "No--yours my forfeit blood and breath;
    These hands are chained, but let me die                             
    At least with an unshackled eye--
    Strike:"--and as the word he said,
    Upon the block he bowed his head;
    These the last accents Hugo spoke:
    "Strike"--and flashing fell the stroke--
    Rolled the head--and, gushing, sunk
    Back the stained and heaving trunk,
    In the dust, which each deep vein
    Slaked with its ensanguined rain;
    His eyes and lips a moment quiver,                                  
    Convulsed and quick--then fix for ever.

    He died, as erring man should die,
      Without display, without parade;
      Meekly had he bowed and prayed,
      As not disdaining priestly aid,
    Nor desperate of all hope on high.
    And while before the Prior kneeling,
    His heart was weaned from earthly feeling;
    His wrathful Sire--his Paramour--
    What were they in such an hour?                                     
    No more reproach,--no more despair,--
    No thought but Heaven,--no word but prayer--
    Save the few which from him broke,
    When, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,
    He claimed to die with eyes unbound,
    His sole adieu to those around.

                    XVIII.

    Still as the lips that closed in death,
    Each gazer's bosom held his breath:
    But yet, afar, from man to man,
    A cold electric shiver ran,                                    
    As down the deadly blow descended
    On him whose life and love thus ended;
    And, with a hushing sound compressed,
    A sigh shrunk back on every breast;
    But no more thrilling noise rose there,
      Beyond the blow that to the block
      Pierced through with forced and sullen shock,
    Save one:--what cleaves the silent air
    So madly shrill, so passing wild?
    That, as a mother's o'er her child,                                 
    Done to death by sudden blow,
    To the sky these accents go,
    Like a soul's in endless woe.
    Through Azo's palace-lattice driven,
    That horrid voice ascends to heaven,
    And every eye is turned thereon;
    But sound and sight alike are gone!
    It was a woman's shriek--and ne'er
    In madlier accents rose despair;
    And those who heard it, as it past,                                 
    In mercy wished it were the last.

                    XIX.

    Hugo is fallen; and, from that hour,
    No more in palace, hall, or bower,
    Was Parisina heard or seen:
    Her name--as if she ne'er had been--
    Was banished from each lip and ear,
    Like words of wantonness or fear;
    And from Prince Azo's voice, by none
    Was mention heard of wife or son;
    No tomb--no memory had they;                                        
    Theirs was unconsecrated clay--
    At least the Knight's who died that day.
    But Parisina's fate lies hid
    Like dust beneath the coffin lid:
    Whether in convent she abode,
    And won to heaven her dreary road,
    By blighted and remorseful years
    Of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;
    Or if she fell by bowl or steel,
    For that dark love she dared to feel:                               
    Or if, upon the moment smote,
    She died by tortures less remote,
    Like him she saw upon the block
    With heart that shared the headsman's shock,
    In quickened brokenness that came,
    In pity o'er her shattered frame,
    None knew--and none can ever know:
    But whatsoe'er its end below,
    Her life began and closed in woe!

                    XX.

    And Azo found another bride,                                        
    And goodly sons grew by his side;
    But none so lovely and so brave
    As him who withered in the grave;
    Or if they were--on his cold eye
    Their growth but glanced unheeded by,
    Or noticed with a smothered sigh.
    But never tear his cheek descended,
    And never smile his brow unbended;
    And o'er that fair broad brow were wrought
    The intersected lines of thought;                                   
    Those furrows which the burning share
    Of Sorrow ploughs untimely there;
    Scars of the lacerating mind
    Which the Soul's war doth leave behind.
    He was past all mirth or woe:
    Nothing more remained below
    But sleepless nights and heavy days,
    A mind all dead to scorn or praise,
    A heart which shunned itself--and yet
    That would not yield, nor could forget,                             
    Which, when it least appeared to melt,
    Intensely thought--intensely felt:
    The deepest ice which ever froze
    Can only o'er the surface close;
    The living stream lies quick below,
    And flows, and cannot cease to flow.
    Still was his sealed-up bosom haunted
    By thoughts which Nature hath implanted;
    Too deeply rooted thence to vanish,
    Howe'er our stifled tears we banish;                                
    When struggling as they rise to start,
    We check those waters of the heart,
    They are not dried--those tears unshed
    But flow back to the fountain head,
    And resting in their spring more pure,
    For ever in its depth endure,
    Unseen--unwept--but uncongealed,
    And cherished most where least revealed.
    With inward starts of feeling left,
    To throb o'er those of life bereft,                                 
    Without the power to fill again
    The desert gap which made his pain;
    Without the hope to meet them where
    United souls shall gladness share;
    With all the consciousness that he
    Had only passed a just decree;
    That they had wrought their doom of ill;
    Yet Azo's age was wretched still.
    The tainted branches of the tree,
      If lopped with care, a strength may give,                         
      By which the rest shall bloom and live
    All greenly fresh and wildly free:
    But if the lightning, in its wrath,
    The waving boughs with fury scathe,
    The massy trunk the ruin feels,
    And never more a leaf reveals.




                         POEMS OF THE SEPARATION



                    FARE THEE WELL.

           "Alas! they had been friends in youth;
           But whispering tongues can poison truth:
           And Constancy lives in realms above;
           And Life is thorny; and youth is vain:
           And to be wroth with one we love,
           Doth work like madness in the brain;

                                              

           But never either found another
           To free the hollow heart from paining--
           They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
           Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
           A dreary sea now flows between,
           But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
           Shall wholly do away, I ween,
           The marks of that which once hath been."
                                      Coleridge's Christabel.

    Fare thee well! and if for ever,
      Still for ever, fare thee well:
    Even though unforgiving, never
      'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.
    Would that breast were bared before thee
      Where thy head so oft hath lain,
    While that placid sleep came o'er thee
      Which thou ne'er canst know again:
    Would that breast, by thee glanced over,
      Every inmost thought could show!
    Then thou would'st at last discover
      'Twas not well to spurn it so.
    Though the world for this commend thee--
      Though it smile upon the blow,
    Even its praises must offend thee,
      Founded on another's woe:
    Though my many faults defaced me,
      Could no other arm be found,
    Than the one which once embraced me,
      To inflict a cureless wound?
    Yet, oh yet, thyself deceive not--
      Love may sink by slow decay,
    But by sudden wrench, believe not
      Hearts can thus be torn away:
    Still thine own its life retaineth--
      Still must mine, though bleeding, beat;
    And the undying thought which paineth
      Is--that we no more may meet.
    These are words of deeper sorrow
      Than the wail above the dead;
    Both shall live--but every morrow
      Wake us from a widowed bed.
    And when thou would'st solace gather--
      When our child's first accents flow--
    Wilt thou teach her to say "Father!"
      Though his care she must forego?
    When her little hands shall press thee--
      When her lip to thine is pressed--
    Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee--
      Think of him thy love had blessed!
    Should her lineaments resemble
      Those thou never more may'st see,
    Then thy heart will softly tremble
      With a pulse yet true to me.
    All my faults perchance thou knowest--
      All my madness--none can know;
    All my hopes--where'er thou goest--
      Wither--yet with thee they go.
    Every feeling hath been shaken;
      Pride--which not a world could bow--
    Bows to thee--by thee forsaken,
      Even my soul forsakes me now.
    But 'tis done--all words are idle--
      Words from me are vainer still;
    But the thoughts we cannot bridle
      Force their way without the will.
    Fare thee well! thus disunited--
      Torn from every nearer tie--
    Seared in heart--and lone--and blighted--
      More than this I scarce can die.

                                           



                     A SKETCH.

             "Honest--honest Iago!
              If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee."
                                                 Shakespeare.

    Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,
    Promoted thence to deck her mistress' head;
    Next--for some gracious service unexpressed,
    And from its wages only to be guessed--
    Raised from the toilet to the table,--where
    Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.
    With eye unmoved, and forehead unabashed,
    She dines from off the plate she lately washed.
    Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,
    The genial confidante, and general spy--                             
    Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess--
    An only infant's earliest governess!
    She taught the child to read, and taught so well,
    That she herself, by teaching, learned to spell.
    An adept next in penmanship she grows,
    As many a nameless slander deftly shows:
    What she had made the pupil of her art,
    None know--but that high Soul secured the heart,
    And panted for the truth it could not hear,
    With longing breast and undeluded ear.                               
    Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,
    Which Flattery fooled not, Baseness could not blind,
    Deceit infect not, near Contagion soil,
    Indulgence weaken, nor Example spoil,
    Nor mastered Science tempt her to look down
    On humbler talents with a pitying frown,
    Nor Genius swell, nor Beauty render vain,
    Nor Envy ruffle to retaliate pain,
    Nor Fortune change, Pride raise, nor Passion bow,
    Nor Virtue teach austerity--till now.                                
    Serenely purest of her sex that live,
    But wanting one sweet weakness--to forgive;
    Too shocked at faults her soul can never know,
    She deems that all could be like her below:
    Foe to all vice, yet hardly Virtue's friend,
    For Virtue pardons those she would amend.

    But to the theme, now laid aside too long,
    The baleful burthen of this honest song,
    Though all her former functions are no more,
    She rules the circle which she served before.                        
    If mothers--none know why--before her quake;
    If daughters dread her for the mothers' sake;
    If early habits--those false links, which bind
    At times the loftiest to the meanest mind--
    Have given her power too deeply to instil
    The angry essence of her deadly will;
    If like a snake she steal within your walls,
    Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;
    If like a viper to the heart she wind,
    And leave the venom there she did not find;                          
    What marvel that this hag of hatred works
    Eternal evil latent as she lurks,
    To make a Pandemonium where she dwells,
    And reign the Hecate of domestic hells?
    Skilled by a touch to deepen Scandal's tints
    With all the kind mendacity of hints,
    While mingling truth with falsehood--sneers with smiles--
    A thread of candour with a web of wiles;
    A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,
    To hide her bloodless heart's soul-hardened scheming;                
    A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,
    And, without feeling, mock at all who feel:
    With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown,--
    A cheek of parchment, and an eye of stone.
    Mark, how the channels of her yellow blood
    Ooze to her skin, and stagnate there to mud,
    Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,
    Or darker greenness of the scorpion's scale--
    (For drawn from reptiles only may we trace
    Congenial colours in that soul or face)--                            
    Look on her features! and behold her mind
    As in a mirror of itself defined:
    Look on the picture! deem it not o'ercharged--
    There is no trait which might not be enlarged:
    Yet true to "Nature's journeymen," who made
    This monster when their mistress left off trade--
    This female dog-star of her little sky,
    Where all beneath her influence droop or die.

    Oh! wretch without a tear--without a thought,
    Save joy above the ruin thou hast wrought--                          
    The time shall come, nor long remote, when thou
    Shalt feel far more than thou inflictest now;
    Feel for thy vile self-loving self in vain,
    And turn thee howling in unpitied pain.
    May the strong curse of crushed affections light
    Back on thy bosom with reflected blight!
    And make thee in thy leprosy of mind
    As loathsome to thyself as to mankind!
    Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate,
    Black--as thy will or others would create:                           
    Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,
    And thy soul welter in its hideous crust.
    Oh, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,
    The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread!
    Then, when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,
    Look on thine earthly victims--and despair!
    Down to the dust!--and, as thou rott'st away,
    Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.
    But for the love I bore, and still must bear,
    To her thy malice from all ties would tear--                        
    Thy name--thy human name--to every eye
    The climax of all scorn should hang on high,
    Exalted o'er thy less abhorred compeers--
    And festering in the infamy of years.

                                           



                  STANZAS TO AUGUSTA.

    When all around grew drear and dark,
      And reason half withheld her ray--
    And Hope but shed a dying spark
      Which more misled my lonely way;
    In that deep midnight of the mind,
      And that internal strife of heart,
    When dreading to be deemed too kind,
      The weak despair--the cold depart;
    When Fortune changed--and Love fled far,
      And Hatred's shafts flew thick and fast,
    Thou wert the solitary star
      Which rose and set not to the last.
    Oh! blest be thine unbroken light!
      That watched me as a Seraph's eye,
    And stood between me and the night,
      For ever shining sweetly nigh.
    And when the cloud upon us came,
      Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray--
    Then purer spread its gentle flame,
      And dashed the darkness all away.
    Still may thy Spirit dwell on mine,
      And teach it what to brave or brook--
    There's more in one soft word of thine
      Than in the world's defied rebuke.
    Thou stood'st, as stands a lovely tree,
      That still unbroke, though gently bent,
    Still waves with fond fidelity
      Its boughs above a monument.
    The winds might rend--the skies might pour,
      But there thou wert--and still wouldst be
    Devoted in the stormiest hour
      To shed thy weeping leaves o'er me.
    But thou and thine shall know no blight,
      Whatever fate on me may fall;
    For Heaven in sunshine will requite
      The kind--and thee the most of all.
    Then let the ties of baffled love
      Be broken--thine will never break;
    Thy heart can feel--but will not move;
      Thy soul, though soft, will never shake.
    And these, when all was lost beside,
      Were found and still are fixed in thee:--
    And bearing still a breast so tried,
      Earth is no desert--ev'n to me.
